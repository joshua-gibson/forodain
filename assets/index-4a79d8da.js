But somewhere along the way, you were branded, between the shoulder and neck.","You wound up on a prison ship, whose guards treated you well, and in your own individual cells – not usually the accommodation afforded to petty crooks. You can’t recall exactly how long its been, nor what time things got interesting at sea. But many days into the trip – to Aeladh only knows where – the ship was rocked, hulled, and taking on water. You got above deck, where a gang of criminals found each other and killed the captain. They then commandeered a raft, and told the others to join them on land, far in the distance.","You struggled on board the raft, some of you blagging passage on the gang’s raft, led by their leader, Basso, and his dwarf henchman Mattis. Others struggled onto one of the other three, picking the same one by chance.","Your choice of raft was fortunate, as once you pushed off, the other two were overrun and carried too many. One made it to dry land, but the other capsized. Despite their cries for aid, you let the criminals drown rather than returning to rescue them and perhaps endangering your own raft.","Hours of exhausting paddling later, you washed up on the stony beach. There, you saw the surviving crew of the ship lined up by Basso and his few men, and slain. Basso noticed your brands, and put you all in one group of branded criminals. He explained that, being branded, you were clearly a prized criminal, perhaps especially dangerous. Your survival would be noticed, and you sought after. If your jailors searched for you they’d not be searching for him, so he’d let you live, as long as you went where he did not. However, Mattis noticed one of your number was Vallasaari, and so shot him dead with his crossbow. To make it up to you, Basso snapped a longspear in half, and advised you to hunt to survive.","The gang then wandered inland. Of the branded group left behind, several others would not travel with you, seeing as how one of you had the daemonic taint of a tiefling! Several of you - an entertainer, a gentleman, and a eerie young girl, wore locked, metal contraptions over their faces, intended to prevent the speaking of magic. These, the tiefling broke apart, and you hailed each other as fellow travellers.","You gathered up what driftwood you could find. After a few hours, with night descending, you discovered a stream to follow. The stream led to a sheltered copse, where you found enough berries, roots, and water to keep you alive.

The man was a deep-woodsman, a man who also bore a tattoo like yours. He made camp with you, and became one of your travelling number.","As you broke camp, two of you went to explore the region further inland, whilst the woodsman went to find one of the deer he spotted yesterday. You stalked the deer after a short hunt, using a long-forgotten implement to improve the range of the spear and perfectly killed the animal, barely spoiling the deer meat and hide. When you returned to camp, a tracker and a soldier awaited, and took you to meet their lord, Ser Harmand Bryce.","The other group journeyed for some time, finding spell components, before spotting a settlement in the distance. Before you could set off, you were apprehended by a patrol of horsemen, who took you to meet the lord of Carrick, Harmand Bryce, at Elsewatch. (edited)","You were taken to the Elsewatch after a long ride, and spoke with Morten, the guard captain, and one young lad. The local folk knew them by name. The lands you passed through seemed impoverished and the people lean and cold. You arrived at the village and keep of Elsewatch at dusk, and were taken to the stables whilst the lord finished his meal. You met Fiddias, his well-dressed halfling steward, whom the guards nicknamed 'the Fidgeter'. In the stables, you chatted with the smith, and spotted that part of the block had been recently affected by fire.","Ser Harmand Bryce, a grizzled veteran, met you in his spartan chamber. The fire burned low, and he offered you good food, before asking you how you got here. You were honest about the shipwreck, and he responded with an offer of a new start in these lands. His price was a small task - find out what started the fire and killed his best destrier. He had previously posted a notice in local taverns seeking help, and paid coin in advance to some mercenaries who went below the castle and never returned with any solutions, nor his money.","You accepted. Fiddias would ensure you had arms, equipment, and a good sleep. The mood in the lord's hall of Elsewatch was relaxed, and capped off by song and music from Bragi and the woodsman, with Rachel watching on at the foot of Ser Bryce's throne."]}],If={title:Cf,sections:Bf},Mf="Elsewatch",jf=[{heading:"A Dungeon",paragraphs:["Later that night, two more of you were taken into the castle. Although you weren’t afforded the same hospitality as the trio in the Lord’s Hall, you got to sleep on good beds in with the others.","The first was a Vallasaari, one of the elves of the mortal world, an outcast descendent of the proud and heretical immortal race. The other was Fair, the Tiefling spirit which inhabited the form of a mortal. Neither of you were welcome in the hall of Ser Harmand Bryce.","The next morning, Fiddias and Morten had you equipped, roping the Vallasaari and Tiefling into the task agreed the night before. Rachel alone got a shield, large enough to hide behind, and you received or crafted your focus objects and holy symbols. And then you were taken to the cellars, and shown an entrance uncovered by the mercenaries before you; a secret wall discovered and demolished. Ser Bryce then told you of the guardian they defeated at the entrance. It was a humanoid creature comprised of stones, powerful enough to require help from Bryce’s guards. The tunnel it guarded extended beneath the courtyard. As you stepped in, Bryce realised he’d asked a lot, and promised you possession of whatever they found underground that didn’t belong to him, and a sum of 100 crowns each. With protestations from the miserly Fiddias ringing in your ears, you went beneath the castle.","The tunnel began narrow, descending, then widened. On one side were holes in the wall, where something had been hammered in, and the floor was carpeted with a bed of reeds, making it difficult to sneak along. It was Nilsson who first spotted the bloodstains, very old, on both the walls and floor. And a dampness in the air. Pressing on, Bragi’s keen eyes picked out a wall different from the others, marked with painted plaster, but none of you could understand the markings. Perhaps a skull?","The passage narrowed again. Down a few steps was an open portcullis. Opened by the last band of mercenaries? It still worked, and the lever on the outside was perhaps intended to keep something locked down here. And then more steps down, the corridor widened once more. Again, hammered gouges lined the wall on one side, and empty torch sconces on the other, but a glimmer of metal revealed what occupied these holes long ago – a rung driven into the stone, and manacles that hung from them. This passage held prisoners. Further along the passage was a skeleton still manacled in its place, bones crumbling to the touch. Agis the Vallasaari noticed a circle of soot on the ground, as if a fire was lit here once. But as the party checked the area for hidden traps, a similar circle up ahead illuminated. And with a puff of smoke, dust, and steam, three small demons appeared. Chattering in a mysterious tongue, they spotted you, and charged to attack."]},{heading:"Demons in the Dark",image:"./img/smoke-demon.webp",paragraphs:["Bragi reacted quickly, blasting the three with wall of sound that disrupted them and pushed the dust demon back. The other two came on, but felt Nilsson’s warhammer. But the creature of dust spun a web of sleep over you, dropping Nilsson and Fair. Agis loosed arrows into them, Rachel, standing by the skeleton, screamed a discordant tone that rent the smoke creature, sending it fleeing into the darkness. Pryce formed eldritch energy into a lance that struck the dust devil, injuring it further. The steam creature, undeterred, blasted boiling air into young Rachel, but quickly found itself disrupted by dissonant tones played by Bragi. Pryce woke Nilsson from his slumber, stepping back to take cover as the lean figure hefted his hammer again. Agis’ volleys of arrows struck home again, and now the steam creature wavered for a moment, barely reforming. Nilsson put an end to its existence with a powerful blow, and now, struck by both Rachel and Pryce, the dust demon wavered too. Bragi thought fast, waking Fair, who discovered a fresh vitality and pounced at the dust spirit with her mace, dispersing it swiftly. And finally, drawing his bow a final time, was ready, as the smoke demon reappeared, chattered wildly, to send it back to the Ethereum from whence it was summoned.","As you gathered yourself after the fight, you noticed the closer of the two soot circles began to sparkle. Rachel understood it to be reforming, perhaps ready to spit out more of the same creatures soon. She also understood that simply dispersing the soot would ruin the glyph. And with a wilful conjuring of air, she swept it away. Nilsson, shunning such extravagance, used his boot."]},{heading:"Traps and Glyphs",paragraphs:["Seconds after you finished dressing your wounds, you met Risvin, a dwarf soldier sent down the tunnel by Ser Bryce to find out what happened to the last band. Risvin clearly came from the same ship as you. The more the merrier, you thought, and Risvin joined your group.","You turned a corner into a chamber with a reed floor and two exits at the opposite side. A set of rusted loops held a frayed rope around the edge of the room. The low ceiling and a hole in floor in the far corner gave you pause, and you stopped to assess the risk. Stepping lightly into the room, Agis discovered that parts of the floor gave way under weight, like one end of a see-saw. Risvin proved his worth, spotting the flaws in the stonework along the walls and picking out which parts of the perimeter were trapped. Nilsson leapt across to join Agis, quickly moving to the opposite end of the room. The others started across, ready to set up a rope so others could avoid the pitfalls. Leaping to take the rope, Agis misjudged, and fell through.","He fell into a chamber 20’ below, the same size as above. He saw a broken grate at one end, along a gully in the floor, which drained a spout that fed it high on the wall of the opposite side. A ledge above him had a corpse on it. The rest of you, seeing the Vallasaari fall, took extra precautions, but Bragi’s leap also failed, and he joined the ranger below. Others of you decided the danger could be controlled, and roped-up to cross the room below, instead of falling through.","Nilsson had no time for this. You stepped through the exit archway into a room with a carved glyph on the floor. There were no other exits. The walls were lined with shelves, the floor muddy, and the ceiling held a set of manacles. One corner had some straw on it, which covered a drain, into which the carved glyph’s groove led. Fresh air came from a small hole overhead, which you guessed led to the stables - confirmed by Risvin. In another corner, you found a strange material, almost translucent, like snakeskin but softer. But then, the caked mud broke apart, and a figure of stone and mud blocked the archway back. As you turned, the glyph beneath you glowed and filled with magma from nowhere. Slowly a creature of molten rock formed. You fought off the mud daemon, before Fair and Pryce joined you, and together you dispatched the pair.","You left the room and checked out the other exit. It was a dead-end store, of no interest. Below, you took a couple of hours to rest and eat, nursing injuries. You investigated the corpse on the ledge, discovering it was garbed like a northern barbarian, much to Nilsson’s - who took the equipment - pleasure. The grate above on the wall dripped now and again, but the outflow on the opposite side was smooth and slippery. Nilsson again took the lead, and slid down the tunnel at great speed. It twisted, turned, and dropped for several seconds, before opening into a chamber into which you crashed, knocking over pots and pans. The chute continued on, but this offered a resting place. The rest of you followed down the chute."]},{heading:"A Gnome",paragraphs:["Nilsson was startled as a voice rang out in the cave. The pots and pans belonged to a gnome named Weylin. He was the last survivor of the group hired by Bryce a week ago. Around him were the corpses of his fellows, whose rations he was eating from the pots you knocked over. He was trapped here because, further below, was a scaled creature that shed its skin and came up the chute now and again. Weylin couldn’t face it alone, so hid here until help showed up. And you have. Looking around, your party found arms and equipment suited to your needs. Fair found armour, Bragi a bodhran, Risvin a battleaxe, Agis a longbow. Pryce couldn’t say what he found, but was visibly overjoyed.","Weylin asked for help to escape his predicament. He said there was no point in returning to the surface back to the castle; his party was peppered with crossbow bolts from behind the dropped portcullis, fatally injuring several of them. The demons did the rest.","So with no way back, you had to press on. Again, Nilsson wouldn’t wait long while there was a beast on the loose. And you were off. You dropped for hundreds of feet along the slippery chute, with the others following close behind. You landed in a pool of muddy, filthy water; a sump in front of another broken grate. Beyond that grate was a dark chamber. A door at the far end shimmered with daylight beyond. But beside it, breathing heavily in the corner of the chamber, about the size of a buffalo, was a scaly creature; the beast mentioned by Weylin. So you javelined it."]},{heading:"The Dungeon has a Dragon",paragraphs:["The creature brushed the javelin off, and turned. It spread out its wings, deep blue, and crackled with lightning. You jumped over the grate and down into the chamber floor. Agis dropped into the pool, backing up and drawing his bow. Then Fair, then Risvin, then Pryce, then Rachel, and finally Bragi, lept into the fray as the creature’s hide resisted your blows. You blasted it with Pryce’s eldritch hexes, Bragi’s whispered curses, and Rachel’s screams that shook its feral mind. Agis’ arrow almost skewered its throat, and it flailed its tail, wings, claws, and ferocious bite in return, all the while sending bolts of lightning from its mouth. Nilsson was felled by a bite as Risvin interposed to prevent his death. It seemed like the creature was about to charge up its lightning bolts again, but Fair’s longsword carried through its guard, sliding barely along its belly, and opening its innards over the tiefling paladin as it fell on top of her.","It was slain.","The beast had slain and feasted on the room’s previous occupant: a nasty, trash-eating Otyugh, and the awful corpse remained. When Weylin joined you, he couldn’t believe you killed them both. On a plinth, a chest was lined with fox furs, and it contained three huge broken eggs, each the size of a man’s head. One had not yet opened. Weylin guessed that when the first egg broke, it ate the contents of the others until it was strong enough to look for better food. The chest was marked with the blue and white crest of Ser Bryce. As Agis investigated the door, it was clearly intended to keep something in. Perhaps the lord of Elsewatch knew of this? Perhaps it was Fiddias’ secret? Either way, returning to the castle would be incredibly dangerous.","And so, while Nilsson and Risvin broke the door down, the rest of you harvested the claws, teeth, and torn hide of the beast. Although not the mantle of a mighty chromatic wyrm, it could yield valuable ingredients. Fair took the egg, kept it warm, and hid it on your behalf among his belongings.","Light spilled into the chamber as the door fell. It was mid-afternoon, and you stood at the base of the hill upon which Elsewatch and its village stood. Weylin pointed down the hillside. The River Else, the edge of Ser Bryce’s lands, was perhaps half a day away, down the valley. The Elseferry was the safest and quickest route across, so he recommended you make all speed to it, before Ser Harmand Bryce and his men caught up with you.","You stepped out into the daylight.

You had Bragi’s tunes to keep the mood light Weylin explained that the ferry was based in Camylborne, the lands of Lord Aldred; known to be a fair and wise lord, and in dispute with Ser Bryce of Carrick. Agis scouted ahead a little, checking for Carrick patrols and setting a good route by cover of the forests.","Your wounds still ached, so you decided to find shelter and rest before making the crossing. You found an ideal spot in a copse which afforded a view of the hills back towards Elsewatch. You set a guard and tended your wounds. Oddly, there were large feathers littering the ground. Bragi knew of Rocs, but Agis assured him these were smaller than Roc feathers. Thankfully.","As the evening drew in, Pryce Ward patrolled the camp. You heard nothing of the three bowshots that homed arrows at you. One arrow found its mark, and you fell to cover. You alerted the others.","Backing up against trees, you all tried spot the attackers. Bragi and Rachel saw deep into the woods and picked them out. Three orc archers with longbows, aiming them overhead to fire down into the camp. Bragi began to circle around them, whilst Agis fired a bowshot in return. Rachel and Pryce could only take cover. Rachel was struck by an arrow as she did so. Agis cloaked himself in the woods, stalking through it like a born hunter. Your track was undetected by the orcs. But still they rained arrows into the camp. If you were to get closer, you needed a distraction.","Pryce obliged, conjuring an illusion of shouting soldiers approaching nearby. The orcs were startled. They took cover, hid, stopping firing, and backed away, closer to Bragi’s position. Bragi pressed on, readying your sleeping spell. Agis was halfway to the hiding orc group, but soon discovered their strategy. Your next step hit metal, and jaws of a trap closed around your leg. Looking around, you saw perhaps a dozen more hunter’s traps, but you managed to get free before the orcs spotted your plight. Rachel was incensed with her injury, and screamed as she ran headlong into the woods towards the orcs. Pryce improved his illusion with the vision of soldiers approaching, and the orcs still hid. But then Rachel was clamped by a hunter’s trap too, and could not get herself free.","The snap of metal traps helped the orcs see through the illusions. One fled for help, the other two stayed. The third lanced Rachel with a thrown spear. It lept out and charged. Agis’ bow tracked it and buried an arrow in its shoulder, but it kept on. As it loomed over her, it slumped to the ground as Bragi finally reached you and sent it to sleep. The third Orc lept up as it saw Bragi’s spell take effect, but was diverted at the sight of the Vallasaari nearby. It burst through the undergrowth and pummelled the ranger with its great axe. Agis drew his blades, whilst Bragi spun and drew its black blood from the flanks. Agis’ footwork forced its guard away, cutting across the chest of the orc and felled it.","You took a moment to recuperate and freed Rachel from the trap, as Agis looked off into the distance. Something wasn’t right. Around the orc position feathers littered the ground, and a rope dangled from the branches of a nearby tree. In its boughs was hung a feathered figure, dressed as a Confessioner of the Shadow. Weylin said it but you all knew it; a cleric of the Covenant would be a valuable ally. Still, Agis couldn’t draw his gaze from the shadows in the distance. You cut down the cleric, a hooded kenku priest, who admitted he was ambushed on his way north.","Then you felt it."]},{heading:"Big Molg",image:"./img/big-molg.webp",paragraphs:["A slight tremor, followed by a grunt.

You tried to lead it into the field of traps. As the orc tried to warn it’s master about the traps, its head exploded like a melon from Agis’ arrow. So on the ogre crashed, headlong into the field of snares. But it simply kicked its way through the field on its way to you.","Agis next arrow puncturing its thick skin at the ribs and dropping it to one knee. It howled as Pryce’s soul reached out to drive an eldritch lance into its mind, but staggered to its feet. The beast lashed out with a wild swing of its club, knocking Agis out. But Pryce’s blast weakened its mind, and you focused attacks there, whittling it down step by step. First Bragi, then Rachel, and then Corwyn, your new cleric ally, who sent a burst of flame at the creature. But it turned to Rachel, its shadow looming over her. She let out a wail, screamed into its soul, and her terror pulsated in ripples from that scream. The ogre staggered, its eyes rolled back, and it collapsed to the ground.","You gathered your wits, dressed wounds, and tracked the ogre’s path back to its lair. Beneath a vine-covered waterfall lay a cave, and deep within that cave was its meagre treasure. The cave was filthy, and attracted all manner of vermin.","You collected what you could, and returned to the camp with Corwyn, to heal, to finish your rest, and then to make up lost time towards the Else Ferry."]}],_f={title:Yf,sections:Of},zf="The River Else",Hf=[{heading:"Ferry Cancellations",paragraphs:["You made good time to the River Else, arriving before midnight. The ferryman’s house on the opposite shore was occupied, and light spilled from a squat, stone building on your side of the river. A path through the rushes led to the unlit ferry jetty lamp, directly across from its counterpart on the opposite shore.","As you approached, you spotted the absence of any actual boat, and too late, you noticed the ropes that guided it trailing in the water. The rushes on either side of you parted, and three gilled humanoid horrors, skin sagging water, with large, glassy eyes, leaped to ambush you with their long, taloned hands. As an isolated scout, Agis is injured and dragged beneath the mud to suffocate, eventually breaking free as the river creatures are distracted by the rest of the onrushing party. You dispatched all three with some difficulty, realising the vicious damage their talons do to shields, armour, and flesh. But as they fell, sallow skin bleeding ichor, water, and blood, you saw movement from all around the river.","Perhaps a dozen more moaning figures, glassy-eyed with jagged teeth and almost lipless mouths, stood in the rushes and water, and began to lope towards you. You made into the squat building for refuge. The river monsters started to hammer on the door. But from the shuttered arrow slits you soon saw them slink back into the river rushes.","You quickly realised it was a Covenant shrine, dedicated to the Bosun. Entombed within was a fallen knight of Carrick, who protected these lands over 150 years ago, and whose effigy is carved on the tomb. A candelabrum stood at the head of his sarcophagus, with a low-burning candle. It appeared to have been burning for at least a day, with perhaps only one hour remaining. Around the base of the candle was an inscription saying:","In Aeladh’s name I ward; With Aeladh’s voice we three banish.’","You considered that the candle was protecting the shrine, and you within, from the monsters, but that three candles could be triggered to destroy or repell them.

He shouted across that the creatures arrived perhaps two days ago, and destroyed his ferry. He said they’re not very smart. You saw from the rooftop that all the bug-eyed creatures looked at him as he spoke, and back at you as you replied. But their ferocity was enough to keep him inside his house; he won’t risk dying to get someone over the river. And he wouldn’t be able to come over with more candles, of which he had half a dozen.","So you tried to lure one out, in the hope it can be charmed. Fair acted as bait, but things didn’t go so well. The creatures skirted around her, keeping their distance until the shrine door was closed behind her. And then they charged. Rachel’s charm spell failed, with Fair almost stranded at the foot of the wall, until Nilsson dropped a rope down to haul her up. But Fair overcame one of the creatures, so Nilsson instead lept down to lend support in the hope of reducing their numbers somewhat. Together with Bragi’s inspirational aid and psychic mockery, Pryce’s horrifying, nether-worldly blasts, and Agis’ bowshots, you felled the three at the base of the shrine. But more, a lot more, were just behind. You climbed back onto the roof, just in time to see them surround the lower portion. And then they began to swiftly climb, catching Bragi off-guard. One tore huge rips in his winter gear, opening a wound. Nilsson and Fair interposed themselves as Bragi fell back. The feral woodsman collapsed the skull of one bulbous head with his great axe, but Fair was quickly surrounded out in front.

Before she fell from the roof, Nilsson had time to gather her up and run back into the shrine, where Pryce was ready with the door open. Bragi and Rachel retreated through the hatch, and bolted it at the same time as Pryce bolted the front doors again.","As you waited, the padding of clawed feet stopped.

You watched Fair step cautiously towards the river. Fair, armoured head to toe in chainmail and with a shield readied at all times, stopped ten feet from the river. After coercion, the leader of the river beasts spoke to the Tiefling. It asked the party to leave the shrine so it could defile it, as the bones interred there were of a knight that kept the river safe - and weak, at the creature saw it. The shrine protected the river. The creature, with a red fin on its head, explained that its master commanded this. And with that ultimatum delivered, it dropped back into the river.","Fair declined, returned to the shrine, shut the doors, and explained what took place. You lifted the lid of the tomb within the shrine, finding only bones, but holy bones at that. So you took the lead, deciding to protect the shrine from this undead scourge.

As Fin and his allies climbed up, Agis' throat gargled with bile. He was drowning where he stood. Rachel popped off a whisper of dissonance, but the creatures heeded it not. Pryce, cornered on the roof, blasted the back of Fin, then jumped back off and around to the door, where Weylin stood to open it. Fair faced down the creatures, defending the hatch, as the Vallasaari coughed up his bile and regained enough composure to make it through. Rachel was already safely inside. Fair lunged, missed, and had her armour rent by Fin's claws. Its human eyes glowed as it tasted blood. Injured, Fair risked letting them down the hatch if she collapsed, and so she jumped back into the shrine instead. This proved her undoing, as she knocked herself out from the fall.

You saw across the river to the roof battle on the shrine. One spotted you and lept down towards the river again. From the door of his house, clad in many layers of ill-fitting chainmail, came the ferryman, who planted his tower shield in the mud, and levelled his arbalest. You dove into the river.","Pryce took up position at an arrowslit. His blast arced out the slot, hitting the running beast dead before it got to the river. Rachel administered a potion to the fallen Fair, getting her back on her feet. The river trolls hammered on the hatch, almost opening it.

You could see Bragi at the near shore, ready to return, but with no way in. Again, Fair took the lead, and hefted her shield as Pryce opened the doors. You charged.","Your blade lanced into the nearest horror. With your whispered prayer, radiant energy filled the blade, and the creature was blown apart. Agis notched an arrow, Pryce fired a blast, and Rachel screamed a curse, but your target withstood. From nowhere, a crossbow bolt shattered its head.

The snuffed-out candle would not rekindle. Pryce yelled across, and asked what prayer was required to banish the undead. The ferryman replied that any faithful prayer to Aeladh would do.","Rachel replaced the dead candle with the third new one. You looked at the candelabrum, remembering what the ferryman said. Only the prayer of a believer would light them all. And you knew no prayer to light them. Fair, the paladin, had no prayer to this God either.

She was said to be a good judge of character, so if they wanted to be so armed and stay in the village, she would give her blessing for now. But her assistant Hulner, a fully-armoured dwarf cleric of the Wright, would stick with them to show them around the village. Whether Hulner knew everyone was another thing.","Your afternoon was spent getting to know the village. Fair spent some time visiting the villagers. Where you found ailments, you worked medicine, where you found wounds, you healed. You started to get a reputation for kindness among the commonfolk.","Even better news was that Pryce and Rachel managed to find rooms for the night, so you retired to the Spittle Inn. You spoke to Marla Spittle, who happily let Bragi and Nilsson play for the evening. During the Shieldmeet feast other musicians would play, but they had the taproom for a few nights if they wanted. Everyone was pleased at the results, until Agis appeared, which irked several of the farmers and travelling merchants. The usually peaceful Vallasaari clans of the region had grown bolder, and some locals spoke of threats and intimidation by the normally-insular elf-kin.","The music impressed the knight of the manor, Ser Davian Oss, sworn sword to Lord Aldred. He asked you to remain in the village until the feast was over; he could use extra fighters to keep the visiting merchants in line; swords on belts tend to do that.

He heard villagers talk of green flames initially, and he suspected foul play. Even Fair, when she searched the burnt-out kitchen, detected a fiendish presence. But the knight had plenty of work to do, but trusted the party enough to let them investigate this on his behalf.

From there, west past the abandoned farms would take you to the top of the gorge.”","You paid the money, took the map, and explained the change of plan to the halfling when he returned!"]},{heading:"The Waste",paragraphs:["Your evening at the Old Boar Inn was spent entertaining the locals with song, and learning a thing or two about the local land in return. One farmer pulled up a chair and explained a little of the wasteland, known as the Ashen Waste, between here and the gorge. It existed for many decades, and his family farm tried to work pockets of the land but failed, going to work for another farmer instead. He showed you a clump of twisted vines, remnants of creatures they slew last month. Nothing grows in the waste but barbed plants. And some sprout these vines, which come to life in deadly fashion. Fire is their enemy, he confirmed.","The next morning, you visited the Hucrele store, from where you purchased oil. Kerowyn Hucrele and her husband ran the store, and sold you a selection of potions donated by the Camelborne court mage, who passed this way last month. Their daughter Sharwyn accompanied a warrior called Maynard from Ashford and a Vallasaari ranger to the gorge in search of the Goblin Apple two weeks ago. She learned magic from a young age, but avoided service for her lord. They assumed her dead, but asked you to bring her back from the gorge if she survived. They would reward you with 200 crowns, plus your outlay for the potions (some 300 additional crowns).","And so you made off early for the gorge, climbing the switchback track up the cliffs as the barkeep suggested, following the track north around the gnarled oak woods, and heading west once you climb above the treeline. From there, the bare, lifeless land lay ahead. Agis checked the land as you passed through – it seemed unnaturally desiccated, decades old, and flat. The familiars of Pryce and Rachel spotted ruined, lifeless farmhouses nearby, and a set of obelisks further west. The track disappeared into the dust, and shoots of barbed plant-life sprouted here and there. But in the mid-morning cool sun, you passed through undisturbed, and so to the obelisks.","Two rows of stone pillars marked the end of the trail. But to the north and south, the lifeless plain was torn by a rift some fifty feet across. The pillars marched to its edge, most broken, fallen, or split. A similar pairing of columns lay on the opposite side. You noticed a knotted rope around one of the columns, leading over the edge and down into the ravine.","Pryce sent his familiar down, and saw the rope rest on a ledge some fifty feet down. It had a campfire on it, and signs of passage, both goblin and of others. A switchback stair carved out of the ledge led down to the floor of the ravine, covered in rubble. But the wall of the ravine opposite the stair was made of collapsed masonry, as if a fortress on the surface had been thrown into the chasm. Ruined towers lie strewn across the floor of the area, but from the wall of masonry emerges a round tower, and in front of it a courtyard formed by battlements. The battlements appear as if they are a top of a tower that has been swallowed by the ground. So you descend; down the rope, and then down the stairs, standing in the courtyard in front of the double doors which lead into the ruins.","You step forward to examine the doors, which seem newer than the rest of the structure. Underfoot, some rubble gives way, and Agis steps aside from a fall into a ten-foot deep pit, covered by a trapdoor. In the bottom of the pit lies a goblin corpse, and four giant rats which are annoyed by your disturbance. The rats can’t climb out of the pit fast enough, so you pepper them with arrows and stones to kill them quickly. Volthune, the terrifying familiar of Pryce Ward, sucks up the coins that lie around the goblin body, and regurgitates them in to the grateful hands of its master. Vile."]},{heading:"Shame and Ruin",paragraphs:["Rachel’s eyes roll back in her head, as the unseen shape of her familiar turns into a centipede and crawls under the door. Inside it sees a hollowed-out round tower, its floors long destroyed. Four goblins lie dead in the chamber, one impaled against the wall by a spear. Two other doors lead off deeper into the ruins. Nilsen watches you examine the doors for traps, before swinging them open. ","The impaled corpse hid a series of runes, written in draconic, that give praise to ‘the Old God Ashardalon’. Heresy.","You stepped over the corpses, all looted. The centipede wriggled beneath the southern door, which Agis determined was the less travelled of the two, and found a half-crumbed room which held little other than a door on its completely-intact western wall. The door was carved in the shape of a rearing dragon, a keyhold carved into its open jaws.","Leaving this room behind, the centipede crawls under the northern door and sees a long corridor. Two doors lead off, one straight ahead and one north, halfway along. Nilsen cared not about the northern door, and as the centipede crawled under the door directly ahead, his patience was wearing thin. The centipede had spotted a large, irregular-shaped chamber in which sat a large cage and with many doors off. Wimpering came from one corner of the room. Nilsen didn’t want to listen to a centipede anymore. He smashed open the door.","At once, a small creature, a kobold with a draconic face and scars across its body lept up. It held only a frayed rope, and looked terrified as you charged in. The creature begged for its life, and you learned its name was Meepo, the Ashamed. Meepo was the handler of a sacred creature called Calcryx, but Meepo had been cast aside by his clan because Calcryx had been stolen by the goblins nearby. Meepo, you soon discovered, was a dragon, pearly white, and twice the size of a cow. This was much larger than the previous drake you faced. Nilsen spoke to Meepo, calling him Meepo of the Rope, and asked about the apple. Meepo did not know about it, but his master Yusdrayl would. Yusdrayl was wise, he said. And so you went to seek Yusdrayl.","Meepo took you through the chambers of the ruins to a room with a long hall lined with dragon-shaped, carved stone columns. Some tougher-looking kobolds stood guard here, and told Meepo the go back to his place of shame. He slunk back, and they discussed that Meepo was not instantly slain by you, so you must not want to kill them. They took you to meet their leader, Yusdrayl. At the end of the hall sat a throne made from bones and bits of an old draconic altar. In the jaws of the dragon-shaped altar lay a brass key. Seated in the throne, almost too small for it, sits the massive figure of Yusdrayl, a troll. Either side of her stands and unarmoured kobold, and around her stand four heavily armoured kobolds, her elite guard."]},{heading:"The Favoured Servants of Calcryx (one day)",image:"./img/meepo.webp",paragraphs:["Yusdrayl relaxed in the throne. She asked specific questions, one at a time. But Nilsen ignored them, and roared at her for the apple. She disdainfully looked around you all, and asked which apple you sought. There were two – an apple made of apple, and another apple, made of vines. She saw the vine apple leave here many weeks ago, but it had returned, carried by a Vallasaari ranger. The other apple was not here, and must be below, with the ‘outcast’, a creature called Belak.","You asked why Meepo was cast out, and she replied that it was for many reasons. Meepo had brought shame upon himself by letting the ranger, the knight, and the wizard pass by into the Goblin Den. But more than this, he had lost their patron and sacred totem, the dragon Calcryx, to whom Yusdrayl wanted to teach the ways of wisdom and patience. Calcryx was to be their saviour, to grow large, and lead them to glory and power. Yusdrayl looked forward to being the servant of the dragon. You then asked about the runes and the name Ashardalon. She smiled. Ashardalon was an old god, ancient when men first came to this land, not merely the dragon you see carved into pillars here. But Ashardalon is long gone, making this place perfect for raising Calcryx to similar glory.","She looked around again, and Bragi perhaps thought he noticed a spell had been cast, but without any of the kobolds moving. Yusdrayl’s eyes darted to the invisible familiar and she scowled. Displeased, she ordered her guards before her.","She offered a bargain – return Calcryx to them, and defeat the goblins, and she would permit their safe passage. She offered to show where her traps lay on the way, and recommended Meepo go with you to reclaim the dragon. Meepo was sent for, returned, and was armed with a new rope. He seemed to grow taller and take some pride is getting the chance to reclaim his beloved charge."]}],Zf={title:Xf,sections:Jf},eg="The Sunless Citadel",tg=[{heading:"Abandoned Places",paragraphs:["Negotiations were over, and you left Yusdrayl behind. Meepo led the way back to his room of shame, and led out another door to where stood two kobold guards. They looked bored, arrogant even, and hurled abuse at Meepo as he passed. But Meepo kept his head down and continued around the corners to an ancient stone door on the north wall. Here he paused and disarmed two traps, before standing aside and letting you tackle the door.","Rachel’s eyes frosted over again and your centipede-like familiar crept under the door to see a room beyond covered in rat droppings. But it was empty, so you pushed the door and it opened safely. Agis located two sets of tracks, some human-sized, others likely goblinoid. All the tracks led north to another stone door. You checked its edges and found nothing dangerous, so pushed it open.","The chamber beyond was long, with two main rooms connected by a corridor off which were six doors. In the first room was a dried out fountain, carved in the shape of a dragon, upon which Bragi located an inscription. It read 'Let there be fire.' Pryce, Nilsen, and Fair tried to start a flame using means both mechanical and magical, but nothing happened. Around the room you could see small patches of soot, as if caused by small blasts."]},{heading:"Unquiet Souls",paragraphs:["Rachel led away toward an ornate door opposite the fountain, and sent your familiar beneath it. Inside it saw a room lined with upright sarcophagi, carved with very old Vallasaari figures. At the end of that room was an altar, upon which sat three items: a candle that burned brightly, a crystalline whistle, and a dusty glass vial. Fair looked at the door to this chamber and she spotted an inscription over the door, reading “rebuke the dead and open the way.” But Fair’s creed gave her power over demons, not the undead, and your channelling of that power seemed to do nothing to the door. But you saw that the door was unlocked anyway, and opened it. As it opened, a sharp, scythe-like blade struck out from a concealed cavity in its centre, cutting into your torso. Fair cursed her luck, but things would get worse.","Fair stepped into the room, noting the Elven (or Vallasaari) tombs, and towards the altar. As you stepped halfway in, followed by Pryce, Volthume (his familiar), and Ristvynn, the six sarcophagi opened. From those on the north wall came grimly-armoured skeleton soldiers, possessed of a vengeful menace. From those on the south wall came much more shambling skeletons, armed with poor weapons.","The battle was hard-fought. Ristvynn held off two foes until Nilsen and Agis arrived, outflanking them and eventually cleaving through them both. Fair toiled but eventually left one smouldering in hellfire-ash as Rachel disrupted another’s possessing malevolence enough for Bragi’s crossbow to find its mark. Pryce calmly resisted the sword-blows of your soldier-foe, before casting its possessing force to the far corner of the room. Here, you all pressed your advantage, leaving the last undead soldier a heap of dried and dead old bones. At this point, you saw the whistle was gone from the altar, so you took the other things."]},{heading:"The Thin Green Line",image:"./img/dead-knight.webp",paragraphs:["Meepo stood back again as you explored further. Agis followed the tracks of the goblins to a door in the west wall of the dragon-fountain room. But those of the humans seemed to head north, before leading back again. Agis followed them north, and into another room with another dried-out dragon fountain. It seemed like two pit-traps had been disabled here, a sign of other dungeoneers’ passing. The tracks led to a door in the west wall of this room.","You discussed options, and decided to head for the goblins first. Ristvynn took a moment and read out the inscription on the first fountain, which filled with bright orange liquid before guttering out. Ristvynn and Nilsen filled a flask each with the liquid. Meanwhile, Fair, Bragi and the others checked the six doors in the corridor, finding them to be empty cells, only home to a few rat nests. Big rat nests.","Meepo felt it unwise to rest here, so you refreshed yourselves instead before doubling back to the door with the goblin prints. The centipede surveyed beneath it, and found the room beyond to be empty, with only a door in the north wall. So you all stepped in, grateful for an untrapped door. Agis leaned against the northern door, listening as the centipede familiar looked beneath it. The room was long, and at its far end was a crenelated wall, behind which the centipede (and Agis) heard the chattering of goblins. But between their defensive position and the door lay hundreds of caltrops.","Fair, realising the danger, counselled against a frontal assault. You agreed a plan instead. Agis slowly opened the door, and avoided the bell-trap that hung above it. The door opened just enough to give Pryce a peek inside. Enough of a peek to put five of the six goblins to sleep in an instant. The remaining leader, shocked at his charges’ laziness, lept to his feet to see Bragi blast the caltrops aside with a blast of wind, and Nilsen’s frenzied form leap over the wall to plant a greatsword into its skull.","Meepo was amazed at your plan. “Their front line was not to tough after all,” he mused, “but better than ours…”"]},{heading:"The Nest",paragraphs:["You again decided against a short rest. The centipede snuck under the door in the goblin outpost, and made its way down a corridor and around a corner to see a trio of archery targets lined up, and a low, crenelated wall opposite, behind which sat a group of bickering goblins. The centipede traced its way back to your room.","You returned to the second dragon fountain, and saw the tracks of the other humans here. The tracks led to a door to the west, returning again and going south towards the goblin lines. Fair investigated the door and was overpowered by the stench from behind it. Agis and Pryce examined the fountain. It was much like the last; carved in a dragon shape over an empty bowl. A search revealed three things: a set of pipes in the mouth of the dragon, a drum exposed within the dragon sculpture, and an inscription that read, “Let there be death.” You decided not to read this one out.","Riswynn checked the traps on the floor, wedged open with spikes and disarmed. You checked the door for more and found none. You pushed open the door to the stinking room beyond. The door pushed against a horrid carpet of grease, hair, bones, blood, and rotten meat. Shapes shifted in the mass of rotten filth that was the den of a huge mother rat, interrupted as she suckled her young, her hide ripe with pustules. Other giant rats scurried to the door. Fair pulled the pit lid away, and Nilsen threw a flask of oil into the room and set it alight. The mother rat lept out of the door and across the pit, its claws and teeth dripped with disease, fell upon Nilsen, biting and clawing him, but eventually dying by his blade. Between you all, the rest of her brood all perished.","The inside of the den was awful. Nilsen’s boots sank into the mire of filth, but Pryce’s creature, Vulthoom, dove ‘head’ first into it. You all spotted a humanoid corpse there in the muck. Fair pulled it out – the corpse of a Vallasaari ranger. You looted the remains, which you recognised as those of the huntsman who accompanied Maynard and Sharwyn down here. You happily left, especially once Vulthoom resurfaced with coins and gems hidden among the wretched mess."]},{heading:"The Raid",paragraphs:["Returning to goblin archery range, you worked on a plan. The centipede scouted ahead again, but a new goblin, a shaman of sorts, had joined them, and it spotted traces of your unseen spy. So the centipede familiar escaped under a door to the west of the archery targets. In this room, it saw a cluster of kobold prisoners tied to a bar on the floor, and a cage that held a halfling.","Your plan was now ready, and Fair led the way, shield up, and charged the goblins. But they heard your heavy armoured steps, and got ready. Loosing arrows into your shield, the goblins scuttled back and through the doors behind the defensive wall. Their leader did the same, as did the shaman. One goblin fell to Fair’s blade but the others escaped north and west.","Behind their defensive wall, Vulthoom investigated the squalor left behind by the goblins. Up on the ceiling there was an array of cables and hooks, but no traps nearby. Riswynn entered the prison, and tried to convince the kobolds of their plan to free Calcryx. The kobolds were unconvinced, fearful they’d be killed if released, or killed by your party after they helped. You opened the cage and recognised the halfling instantly: It was the one who planned to guide you here. But this halfling, Erky Timbers, didn’t recognise you at all, explaining how he was ambushed by goblins after leading a group of people down here two weeks ago, and during the ambush he was knocked out by a foe that looked exactly like him! He picked up his Covenant holy symbol, a pendant with the marking of Vigil, and offered a quick prayer before dusting himself down. He was eager to return to the surface, but agreed to help you first for freeing him. Meepo spoke to his kin, who were unhappy that he was the one to rescue them. But they agreed to help after Meepo fetched them weapons. Safety in numbers; kobold reasoning.","By this stage, Nilsen was already over the goblin wall and opening the door the goblin shaman ran through. You were peppered by arrows from the goblins in the room beyond, who again melted away through the far door. But one didn’t run enough, the shaman. You caught it in the midst of the chamber, which was piled high with supplies, rations, ropes, and drums labelled ‘Vallasaari Pudding’. As Nilsen charged, it extended its hand, and lashed a deep wound in Nilsen’s chest. Nilsen accepted the pain, and cleaved the goblin in two. Pryce was next through the door, psychically lighting up another goblin in the far room beyond. And Agis, leaning back, loosed a long-range shot into another goblin, until there was only one. It scuttled behind some pillars and away south.","Fair clambered over the goblin wall and went north, following the leader into a long hallway with a strong door at one end and another opposite the way you came in. You moved to the end of the corridor and, too late, heard a click as you stepped forward. The floor opened, and into a deep pit you fell. Rachel heard this, and rushed to the side of the pit to help. But you had your grapple out and began to haul yourself up. As you climbed, you saw the wall with the sturdy door lightly frosted over, and a chill reached down the pit sides. The minute you clambered back up, the other door in the corridor opened, and out rushed the goblin leader, with a crazed ritualist behind him. You were outnumbered. Rachel, standing opposite the door, felt a volley of arrows hit her, and you instinctively reacted by casting a pall of darkness over them all. But it is the curved blade of the goblin boss that felled you in the corridor, hacking where you stood. The ritualist readied a spell but Fair was too quick to react and drove a blade through its chest.","Riswynn now led Meepo and the kobolds charging out of the stockade, and Meepo’s sling smote one archer inside their chamber. Riswynn and Rachel’s familiar struck, taking down the boss and cleared a path through for Erky Timbers to heal Rachel. Riswynn buried an axe into the head of one of the two remaining archers, and watched Agis dart from his bowman’s stance, across the room, and slice a neat line across the last goblin’s neck in an instant."]},{heading:"The Trophy",image:"./img/goblins.webp",paragraphs:["Pryce watched as Nilsen approached a door in the room vacated by the goblins. Pryce stood in the supply room, a larder of sorts, and Vulthoom regarded a set of nets with rings attached. It flopped on them, and emoted a series of painful waves. It drew your attention to the hooks on the ceiling in the room adjacent. A falling net trap, evidently, was intended for intruders such as you. But the lazy critters hadn’t set it up. Then you heard Nilsen speak in the next room, which was lined with draconic columns and had a low, white fog that was beginning to rise.","Nilsen stood in front of another frosted-over door. You listened at the door, and heard the rumble of a large creature breathing on the other side, and called the name of Calcryx. It answered in a rasping drawl “At last, I’m becoming bored.” You called for Meepo, who arrived presently, and fresh from chalking up a goblin kill. Meepo the Slayer. He saw the frost and his eyes lit up. “Calcryx!” he exclaimed, “We shall be together and Meepo shall continue the teaching of Calcryx so that she can lead the People of Yusdrayl”.","So you happily explained that Meepo was here to see it, to which it rumbled “Meepo? The torturer?! That pathetic creature? Excellent. You can send my thanks to Durnn for that morsel.” Meepo looked at you, then away, confused.","He said “Perhaps Calcryx has a different way of seeing things, I think.”"]},{heading:"Calcryx the Magnificent, Ambitious, and Bored.",paragraphs:["You all assembled in the long hall lined with two rows of draconic-sculpted columns, outside the room that held the white dragon Calcryx. But you were eager not to be ambushed, and so you sent the centipede familiar, Sárgo, under the door to investigate. The room was a guard post, packed with terrified goblins. But the goblins here were ready, and five peppered the invisible space occupied by Sárgo, injuring it. Realising the danger, Rachel unsummoned her familiar to safety. But the goblins held out in their barracks. So Fair decided to barricade them into the room, and piled up barrels from the supply store against the door. It served as a warning in case they tried to sneak out while you dealt with the dragon. The kobolds prisoners stood guard as Meepo unlocked the door to Calcryx’s chamber.","Agis investigated the middle northern door, listening at first, then peering through to the empty corridor beyond, hearing distant barked orders from around the corner. And Riswynn put her ear to the door at the end of the hall, and heard many goblin voices. Meepo stood at the door to Calcryx’s chamber, shaking his head at her words, confused as to why she hated him so much. You beckoned him away from the door, and all of you gathered in the supply store to formulate a plan. Then Fair stepped out to Calcryx’s door, knocked, and opened it.","Within was a room dusted with frost, and with the wreckage of furniture everywhere. In the middle of the room was an iron spike driven in the floor, and a broken chain leading off north. A semi-circular wall lay opposite the door, and high up on it were mounted the heads of some creatures; cattle, a kobold, some rats, and other unimpressive specimens. But below these petty trophies lay the glistening form of a white dragon, roughly the size of a coach and horses – Calcryx the Magnificent – which glared at you.","Fair bent low, weapons away, and addressed the creature as its station required. The white dragon described her capture by a large hairy goblin, which snuck up and beguiled her to imprison her in this room. Fair, holy knight of untamed nature, stood before one of its apex predators and praised its majesty. You explained your plan to set Calcryx free, to rid her from the machinations of Yusdrayl and the power games between goblin and kobold inhabitants. Calcryx, impressed at Fair’s honesty, agreed that Yusdrayl was a poor imitation of the dragon priests of old. She offered you the chance to be leader of her new followers, to serve her in the lair that she would make from the gorge and the citadel, and to watch as she hunted these lands as her ancestors did. Calcryx remarked that Meepo, whom she wished to devour, told stories of knights seeking dragons who died at their hands, and pondered if this tiefling had such a quest. Fair was clear, she did not wish to destroy Calcryx, but to let her become a proud dragon, that would be an example to her kin. So the white dragon asked Fair to help her destroy the kobolds, for whom she had no use, and bring her the leader of the goblins.","Fair left the room, and returned to the others. Meepo was concerned at your plan, but did not want to die instantly. But now Calcryx had left her room and into the larger hall adjacent. Here she stretched out her wings, and the kobolds left here to guard the goblin room begged for their lives as she blasted them with her freezing breath. Fair came back out, and stood before the monster once more. He pulled the barrels away, explaining to Calcryx that beyond the door lay some of these same subjects she desired, who disrespected her by hiding within. Calcryx simply waited, and watched. When the barrels were removed, you flung the door open, and dove aside as the goblins again loosed a volley of arrows at you. Calcryx waited, and then asked what Fair expected her to do, as she was still awaiting the goblin leader. As you spoke together, Agis took up a position, hidden behind a pillar, behind the dragon with bow trained on the goblin guards’ door. Nilsen slowly snuck from the supply room and hid behind the dragon at another pillar. But Fair saw as a chilling mist rose from around Calcryx, and saw the dragon instinctively place its four legs wide and lift its head to prepare for an attack. Its tail flicked near Nilsen’s pillar, and its head could reach as far as Fair.","Agis, using the rising mist as cover, tried to dart past the wary dragon. You passed right behind the rear of the beast, but it marked you well, and turned to face, angry and suspicious at your attempts to hide from it, and demanded you stop at once. But you ignored its roaring demands, and darted to the north door, and the dragon struck, buffeting you with its claws on your way out of the room. Now the dragon was furious. It had been disrespected, and it demanded Fair fetch the head of this impudent Vallasaari.","Nilsen had seen enough. You quaffed a potion, and felt the strength of volcano-dwelling giants in your muscles. You lept at the dragon, and with all your frenzied, frothing might, pinned it to the ground. With a free hand you pulled out a javelin, and jabbed it at the beast’s head. It snapped and clawed at you, and swung you around on its neck. It froze the far end of the room with a burst of icy breath, but you were too close to reach."]},{heading:"Sacrifices",image:"./img/white-dragon.webp",paragraphs:["Riswynn, Meepo and Rachel now stood at the other door to Calcryx’s lair. Meepo unlocked that door too, and you darted through. Riswynn, seeing the battle in the room beyond, could tell Nilsen needed help. You reached into your pack and pulled out a gem. You broke it on the stone floor, and the air swirled. It reached up to the ceiling and took form; an elemental force of air to do your bidding. So you set it on the dragon.","Pryce stepped into the dragon’s mind, and put within it the vision of a silver dragon head bursting through the far doorway. But Calcryx knew it was the only dragon here, and it shrugged off the illusion. However it was enough of a distraction, and let Fair charge across the chamber and back into the fray. The elemental slammed into the dragon, which was pinned by Nilsen’s superhuman strength. It became the focus of Calcryx’s ire, and it bit, clawed, and blasted frozen air at the elemental.","Meepo stared, frozen with anger at your attempts to kill his dragon. His eyes grew red with anger, and he gripped his weapons tightly. Rachel ignored this and perused the dragon’s small hoard, pocketing some scrolls. But Riswynn kneeled to speak to him, explaining that Calcryx was an evil creature, that hated Meepo, and was too dangerous to live. Meepo turned away, and whimpered “I know.” He again regarded the dragon he raised from an egg, but turned away again to Riswynn, saying “You are right. Meepo cannot save Calcryx now.” And as he perused the dragon’s hoard, his demeanor changed. He spotted a crystal goblet. “Thieving dragon took my cup!” Meepo exclaimed, and he seemed sterner now.","Agis tended his wounds, gulping down a potion in the corridor, as Vulthoom took a share of coins and a jade statuette from the hoard, back to a welcoming Pryce. You peered around the corner of the pantry door, and took a pot-shot at the writhing dragon with your eldritch lightning, searing scales from its hide.","Nilsen wrapped his legs over the pinned head of Calcryx, and tried to mount it, grabbing his greatsword from its sheath. As you got both hands on the blade, you lost your grapple, and the dragon finally pitched you off. It reared back, snorting frost as it rose to its full height. Agis now rushed to the doorway behind the beast, notching one of the ancient arrows found beneath Elsewatch Keep. It sank into Calcryx’s wing, and the dragon seemed off balance for a moment. Just as you felt under control at last, the goblins surged out of their hiding place, loosing arrows at anything nearby, and their witch-doctor charged into Agis, but flailed uselessly at the Vallasaari archer. The other goblins fled west and shut the door behind them.","Calcryx reared back, and a layer of frost grew around its bulky body. It drew in the air of the old citadel, and blasted a hurricane of searing cold across the rooms in front of it. Nilsen collapsed from the cold, Pryce and Rachel getting out of the way in the nick of time, but Riswynn faced the cold death exposed. Meepo saw you, and could not bear the loss of two friends in one day. He lept in front of the dwarf, pushing you beyond the reach of the cold, but the blood in his veins froze, and he hit the ground lifelessly. His last words fell from his frosted lips, “You were right.” And at that, Meepo died.","After the blast, Calcryx raged at the elemental, severing its magic bond, sending its essence back to the Ethereum. Free of her strongest foe, her hind leg kicked out at Fair, and it turned to face the you. It growled, muttering draconic curses at you, frost crowning its jaws once more. Riswynn screamed curses, running at the white dragon from behind, but your axe swung into the thickest of its hide, and even the assistance of Erky Timbers couldn’t help. But you ducked the dragon’s riposte, and gave a potion to the lips of the dying Nilsen. The northman struggled, exhausted, to his feet. You all stood, exposed and injured before a dragon now confident of victory. Pryce shook the ice off his fingers and stood in the doorway. You reached into the monster’s mind once more, and pulled a deep paranoia from the recesses there. You used its fear as a blade, as the dragon’s head jerked up, you dove it into the core of the dragon’s bestial mind, and broke it. Calcryx stumbled around, its eyes glazed over, and a wave of frost covered the chamber as it collapsed heavily in the middle of the floor. Calcryx, the wild, ambitious, and magnificent, was dead.","The goblin witch-doctor screeched as the bedraggled Nilsen ran at it, but it couldn’t avade the killing blow that clove it in two.","The room was quieter now, but you all felt seriously injured. Riswynn collected the corpse of Meepo, and the rest of you threw the Dragon’s loot into a rug. You fell back to the goblin outpost again. Vulthoom oversaw the construction of the net trap on the ceiling, and you set up a trigger, some warning if the goblins approached. But they would be cautious and slow, timid for fear of those who could slay their fearsome dragon.","And so, you rested."]},{heading:"The proposition",paragraphs:["Your watches went undisturbed.

No chance to escape, no negotiation. Durnn was happy with this, but Grenl didn’t want her tribe to become battle-fodder to enrich a hobgoblin. But Durnn’s temperament presented an opportunity; he needed to rule by fear and strength. If one of you challenged him instead of attacking the tribe, he could not lose face by refusing. Kill him, and his hobgoblins, and Grenl would take his place. She could help the party in return.","She explained that the apples all looked alike, but if you knew how to spot the illusion, it was easy to tell the true nature of the poison apple. Its true form was a sphere of roots, vines, and bark, that seems to resemble a little fat man. Agis recognised the Idol from Hamber immediately. Grenl offered to reveal to them which apple was which if they brought them back to her, after dealing with Durnn. ","You asked about the creature that captured Calcryx. That was a huge goblinoid called Balsag the Hunter. Very powerful, very quiet, very sneaky. He was ‘promoted’ and taken beneath by the outcast Belak, who dwelt in the grove below this citadel ruin. Belak tended the vine creatures, one of which Durnn kept as a pet. But only the outcast controlled them, keeping Durnn here as a watchdog against intruders to the grove.","You agreed to her plan, but kept your guard up as she returned back through the barricaded door.","You completed your preparations, and returned to the room with Calcryx’s corpse. It had been partially harvested of teeth and scales, and you spotted signs of goblin activity here again. Bragi slowly approached the large door opposite, behind which you could still hear a lot of goblinish commotion, to find it rigged with tripwires; perhaps an alarm, perhaps a device to harm. You headed north, in the direction of the deeper, louder voices that echoed down the corridor. You passed an often-repaired door leading south, and the noise of the goblins now hid any sounds of your movement. Ahead lay a stone door with a thick handle laid in. Behind this you heard gruff goblin voices; headmen or the chief perhaps. But you made sure and send Sárgo beneath the door to check.","The familiar surveyed a round chamber with a high, domed ceiling, lit by torches. In the middle of the room was a well and a deep hole, out of which grew hundreds of vines and a dim violet light. They shifted a little, evidence of sentience. The other way out of the room led to a large chamber that must have held the goblin tribe, judging by the cacophony coming from it. But the light picked out the inhabitants of the room, Grenl, her goblin underlings, and upon his throne, the chieftain Durnn with his hobgoblin soldiers."]},{heading:"Flame of Thrones",image:"./img/grenl.webp",paragraphs:["Whilst you discussed a plan of attack, and Nilsen became increasingly agitated, Durnn bellowed to his goblins to prepare for an attack, and as he roared, one of Grenl’s shamans spotted the tell-tale traces of your invisible familiar. Grenl was shaken, and the shaman flapped at the invisible familiar as it darted from the door across the room and into the domed ceiling. Just as well too.","Agis hauled the door open, and it swung freely on top of you all standing nearby, collapsing the ceiling on you as well. But Agis darted through the wreckage and straight at the nearest hobgoblin, slicing and stabbing past its heavy armour. Riswynn came next, thinking little of the dust covering her, and muscled through the defences of the observant shaman. As it fell, she was swarmed by hobgoblins and goblin warriors. Grenl noticeably held back. Durnn grabbed his greatsword in two hands, quickly opening multiple wounds through your armour and you collapsed to the ground. The hobgoblin captain spurred his soldiers on, and was ready when Nilsen barrelled into him. Your own greatsword sliced through the weak spots in his armour, as Pryce backed off and blasted him with lightning. He shook off Rachel’s whispering doubts that forced him back for a moment. But Nilsen’s roared challenge was laughed off; even Grenl could see this was no personal challenge as she’d hoped. The chieftain, battered and dazed from Nilsen’s relentless assault, yelled for his goblins to aid him.","The other hobgoblins charged into melee with Nilsen and Agis. Agis fended off their strikes, darting from the worst of their flurry but taking cuts and bruising blows. As they readied their next attack, a cloud of biting, slicing blades appeared, and carved through their ranks. Bragi directed the shredding knives through the goblins, who had no time to get clear, and perished under the assault.","Grenl looked at her overlord, and his loyal soldiers, and saw her chance. Weakened by your attack, Durnn commanded her to help. So she helped herself. A roar of flame erupted and engulfed the combatants, making blackened corpses out of the goblins and hobgoblins. Durnn stumbled in the conflagration and fell to his knees, dead. But Nilsen, Riswynn, and Agis also lay unconscious and dying by the second. Erky Timbers rushed forward, but Grenl stopped him from administering aid. She called down the passage to you, and as her goblin tribesfolk arrived to defend her, she asked you to stand down. Durnn was dead as agreed, but no more goblins would die today, unless, she enquired, you wished to watch you fellows die in a further flamestorm.","So you called a truce. The goblins agreed to let you recover, for a short time, under their watch. They quickly went to work making repairs to their lair; Grenl took the throne, and her shamans and enforcers paid homage to her. She asked you not to delay your progress below, to seek out the apples in the grove of the Outcast."]}],ng={title:eg,sections:tg},og="The Grove of Gulthias",ag=[{heading:"Under the Goblin Gaze",paragraphs:["You rested under the watchful eye of Grenl’s goblins. They continued stripping the corpse of the white dragon Calcryx, and now did the same with their former hobgoblin masters. But they backed down when Nilsen proposed keeping the weapons and armour of their leader, Durnn. Grenl had no use for the armour, and the sword was no use to her either. So his burnished mail armour was adjusted to suit Bragi and his serrated greatsword seemed to suit Nilsen.","Agis spoke to Grenl, and discovered that the Outcast, Belak, lived below in the Grove. There, he was served by many of the twisted root guardians that attacked you above. Alongside these were goblins that he ‘promoted’, including the hunters and their leader, the mighty Balsag. But Grenl had no map to offer, as none of her kin that went down ever returned, aside from Balsag and the other hunters. And the vine creatures that returned below rarely appeared back up here.","You looked down into the vine-covered well-shaft, and a purple haze blocked your vision and darkvision to the room below. Agis tied a rope around a nearby torch bracket, and began to climb down. Vulthoom lept over the edge and tucked its horrid wings in, diving to the floor and below the mist at the foot of the shaft. Both he and Agis arrived in the corner of a large chamber, lined in old stone but covered in thick vines; almost like roots. A haze hung thick in the air, but the room was lit with a violet luminescent fungus that grew in clumps. But gently swaying at the other corner of the room were two robed skeletons. They didn’t move, other than to shift their weight around, and to follow your movement with their dead eye sockets. One held a basket and a small knife, the other a knife and a sickle. The rest of you scaled down the rope and vines of the shaft as Agis checked the southern door for goblin traps."]},{heading:"Where Nothing Grows",paragraphs:["The room was riven with vines, but few grew around the southern doorway. Fair noticed, and opened the door, leading the way into a passage that led to a deep ravine. The cavern cleft ran for dozens of yards in both directions, and shifted the opposite side of the passage by some fifteen feet. A challenging leap for sure. Bragi led the way, slowly hammering in pitons to form a secure route across for the others. Vulthoom flapped off down the ravine, spotting dozens of similar, two-foot wide holes in the wall of the chasm, all the way down to its bottom some fifty feet below. Sargo buzzed along to the far western end of the gap, and found a mining node with similar holes in the walls.","When you all made it across, Erky Timbers decided to hold the gap and keep watch. You all crossed over, and a passage led around corners to a swollen stone door. Agis again found no traps, but the door took both Nilsen and Fair to pry open. The dust and dirt and water of ages had sealed the room shut. But within, although it was once a grand shrine, you found the room bereft of its valuable trinkets. A statue of a dragon, much like those above, sat at the far end of the room, but instead of a fountain, this one merely held an offering tray. It was empty. Riswynn and Fair identified the room as a safe place to rest, and the whole area had no vines and no foes. And then you heard the shriek of Erky Timbers back at the cleft.","As Agis, Nilsen and Bragi turned the corner, the source of the holes was apparent. Two burning snakes the size of large dogs darted towards the fleeing Erky. Agis sent a volley of arrows into one, helped by Bragi’s poisoned quarrels to bring it down before it reached the halfling. Bragi, having faced these things before, warned against getting too close. But Nilsen ran into the other, recoiling as its snakeskin radiated flames, and chipped away at its burning hide with the help of the onrushing Riswynn’s battleaxe to extinguish its fire. Both lay dead, crumbling to ash, their spirits back to their flaming locales in the Ethereum.","As the embers faded, Sargo flapped along the rift, and found a windy gap in the rock face, through which it flew into a small room with a well-used door that had the sounds of tinkering beyond. The rest of you returned to the shaft room and investigated the other door. All this time the skeletons hadn’t moved, only turning slightly to watch you as you passed by. Behind them the door was sturdy but well-used, and again you heard something tinkering beyond. Checking it over for traps, Riswynn and Nilsen opened the door. Inside was a long room, with pillars carved as dragons, like the floor above. In this long room, working at benches and long tables were goblins dressed in rough working garb, sorting herbs, cutting fungi, and working on the splayed out corpse of a rat. They lept up, startled, and began to run for the door on the far wall. Five other doors closed swiftly along the length of the hall, as goblins inside tried to hide from you. Fair shouted in that Grenl permitted you to pass through, but the goblins wailed back ‘we have a new master now!’ and kept running. And so, in a few short seconds, you cut the fleeing goblins down before they could warn others."]},{heading:"A Hairy Balsag",image:"./img/balsag.webp",paragraphs:["As Nilsen, Agis, and Riswynn inspected the room, Bragi noticed the vines on the floor move, and turned just fast enough to see a morning star crunch into his side. From the shadows loomed a tall, hairy, goblinoid creature with small eyes and a hunter’s poise. It swung the morning star again, and Bragi fell. Those who remained in the shaft room turned to see him collapse, and saw the tall hunter, which wore antlers as a helm and had a pack of javelins at his back. As you readied yourselves, it whistled, and from the northern passage, you heard something approach quickly. Balsag the hunter had found his prey.","Fair raised her shield and felt the thunderous ball and chain hit, staggering you back sufficiently to lose footing for your own strikes. Nilsen bellowed a warning and charged back into the chamber, only to be faced with a rat of monstrous size, more like a bear with rat-like teeth, whiskers, and tail. It squealed and struck, and you battled back and forth with this abomination and its comrade, which blocked Riswynn’s own path into the fray. Pryce tested Balsag’s mind and felt a beast-like resilience there, shrugging off his mental attacks. Rachel became the familiar once again, her eyes rolling back into whites as the imp turned visible and jabbed its stinger into the hunter. Erky looked for a way back around the the dying Bragi, only to watch as Vulthoom rescued the swashbuckling troubadour by prising his lips apart with a tentacle and using its tail to uncork a potion down his throat.","The hunter again pushed Fair back, relentlessly hammering your shield raised just in time. This allowed Agis a gap to strike, having sized up Balsag’s stance and spotted a weakness in his defences. Your quick blades drew dark, bloody cuts in his hide, and the humanoid turned now to face you. Riswynn dispatched one of the rats, helped by a blast from Pryce, and moved towards the hunter. Fair now found her footing, and you lanced a smiting flame into the side of the goblinoid. It retaliated against Agis, smashing into your arm with a numbing shove. Nilsen struggled with the ferocity of the remaining rat-beast, its face riven with vine-like growths. The thing tenaciously avoided his blows, but found its own mark with its claws and bite. But from the air sprang a hail of knives, whirling through the rat’s hide and sending sickly ichor and blood in all directions. Bragi was back on his feet, hand extended and crossbow levelled. Slowly the tide turned. Bragi loosed a quarrel into Balsag, Fair’s smiting blade found its mark, Agis’ swords ripped at its torso, and Sargo’s sting forced it back. But again Pryce understood when its death was near, drawn to the killing blow like a fly to rotting food. Lightning engulfed Balsag’s antler-helm, burning it’s mind and his body, and it fell to the ground, twitching, but dead.","Seeing its master down, the remaining rat fled back north into the passage. And you were left, gasping for breath and covered in Balsag’s blood, in this room filled with vines.","As the body of Balsag bled out on the ground, you took deep breaths and made some quick spot dressing to your wounds. The sense of danger here, and the ever-watchful skeletons, made you apprehensive about resting for longer."]},{heading:"Emancipation of The Goblin classes",paragraphs:["You returned to the goblin workshop, and as Bragi listened at doors, you heard some goblins readying themselves for battle. Asking Erky to translate, you instead asked them to surrender, which they did, and opened the door to lay down their arms. A goblin soldier came to the fore, and told you they work for Belak. They talk in awe of Belak and describe him as wise. But when asked if Belak is a goblin, it laughed and turned slowly to look at Agis. Belak, it seemed, was a Vallasaari.","The goblin soldier helped you round up the goblins in each room off the main workshop. In one room was a repair workshop, in another a grog still, a dormitory, an armory, and a test laboratory, where you found a vial of nasty-looking liquid the goblins said was used on some rats. The rats you saw there were dead, eaten from the inside by horrid root-like growths. In one room you found another goblin soldier, who rebuked the first one for surrendering. Another soldier among them rebukes him for surrendering. You told this goblin he must act as your guide. As for the others, Fair eventually proposed setting them free – a peace offering to Grenl above.","As they scurried back out past the skeletons and up the vines to Grenl’s chamber above, an old man’s voice shouted at them to stop and keep working, coming from the skeletons. When the goblins ignored it, the skeletons drew weapons and attacked. Fair intervened, taking a blow to the leg and as it hit, you engulfed the thing in flames. Rachel pulled several of her favourite stones from her pocket, and smashed the skeleton’s skull off with a volley.","This noise attracted the returning enormous rat, Balsag’s remaining pet. Sargo spotted it approach, and Fair stepped out to prevent it reaching the goblins. It gave the goblinstime, and they clambered up the vines and returned to Grenl’s tribe. The rat charged at Fair, but in its wounded state it posed no danger, and you held it off with your shield before striking its weak belly with your blade. You wiped it clean and returned to the others in the goblin workshop. The goblin guide, Ekvosk, explained that the main door at the end of the room led to a garden chamber, and the grove. He said the gardens are tended by gardeners, some skeletons and the hunters, bugbears, under the leadership of Balsag. Fair investigated another door leading out the same direction, a door to latrine, and found it trapped. Thankfully your shield resisted the fusillade of darts meant to kill you."]},{heading:"Gardeners World",image:"./img/tree.webp",paragraphs:["You all prepared to open the main door described by the goblin. As it slowly opened you saw a mossy, foul garden of fungi beyond. A haze hung low on the ground and the air smelled of rot. Your guide whispered its surprise to see no gardeners here. But nevertheless, their absence left you free to step over the root/lined floor and into the long hallway. Behind each door lay more of the garden complex, which seemed only capable of growing the rotten polyps and glowing fungi you’ve seen thus far. Pryce conjured an unseen servant to avoid the traps, and it prised open one of the doors into a garden chamber. Here, a sickly old tree grew in the centre of an octagonal room. Bragi spotted the mist that covered the ground swirl beyond the tree, and saw one of the fiery serpents hiding there. It had no desire to feel your blade, so kept hidden.","Again, your guide shared its concern at the absence of the gardeners. Either they were away, which was good, or gathering, which was bad, or they were…","…Two shadows sprang from the dim recesses of the hall. One had Pryce cornered, the other loomed up beside Erky Timbers. Both wore black smocks and furry leather armour. Bugbear hunters. Pryce felt the long axe of his foe bite into your side, but it felt a spike of steel from his knife in return. Bragi forced it to flee from the whispers in its mind, and Pryce stabbed again as it fled through the southern door. Erky reacted in time, dodging the first blow from his attacker, who too hit and ran back out of the chamber through the northern door. Agis gave chase. And now, seizing its opportunity, the fire snake darted out to strike Fair.","Agis stood in the doorway, bow trained on the long dark hall beyond. It was much like the one you all stood in, extending the root-covered garden further north and extending into doors north and east. But as your bowshot tracked the room, you saw no sign of the hunter. It had disappeared into the murk again. So you waited. You need not wait long. A long axe jabbed from the shadows, doubling you over, and the creature slammed the door in your face, disappearing off into the shadows once more. Fair darted to and fro with the burning reptile, striking when possible, but getting singed in the process. The creature’s bite found a weak point in your significant armour, and you collapsed unconscious. Pryce looked into the room and saw the creature try to bite and burn your defeated body, and sent an eldritch lance at the thing, followed by more of Rachel’s stones, killing it.","Agis tended his wounds and fell back to the others. The hunters used the dark corridors to their advantage, struck with precision, and melted away.","But Bragi had a plan. Pryce’s ethereal servant opened the door once more, and into the hall crept Rachel alone. You kept your eyes peeled, but as you stepped into the centre of the overgrown hallway, a dark shape landed before you, and stabbed its glaive into your chest. And you disappeared. The hunter turned to see the still-open door and the illusory Rachel fade away. The real Rachel stood beside Agis, who knelt low with your aim trained on the exposed bugbear. As it turned to see you both, its jaw opened and its eyes narrowed. Into the open jaw lanced the bodkin, lifting the hunter by the head and depositing it several yards down the hall, dead before hitting the ground.","The goblin guide whispered ‘one less gardener’ and you looked around for a safe place to conduct more spot dressings, now feeling the effects of several injuries.  "]},{heading:"Ambushing the Ambusher",paragraphs:["You understood that your hunter foes were too good at opportunistic attacks, so you went on the hunt instead. Standing back to avoid an ambush, you sent the phantasm Rachel through the door to the south of the main hallway. The invisible Sargo marked two groups of goblins trying to hide, and as the fake Rachel moved to the far end of the room a javelin hit the ground through her shape. From above the door growled a bugbear, standing on the door lintel. Nilsen and Risvinn found the creature and dispatched it with your axe and blade.","The goblins were pared down to two by the time the bugbear fell. The remaining two dropped their weapons when asked and raised their hands. Your goblin guide laughed at their surrender and teased them for doing so, but you accepted it and offered them the chance to return above to their fellows. They gleefully accepted, and again the guide was left red-faced with shame as you kept him as a guide.","With the doors south explored, you turned north.","The northern passage held two doors, and behind the eastern one was an arboretum much like the others. This one was in the most advanced state of decay, the sickly grey tree in the centre almost collapsed under the fungi and polyps that grew upon it. You sent in the illusion of Rachel, but this time there was nothing to find. The roots on the floor looked the same as elsewhere, but you now realised that these roots were not coming from these trees. Given the extent of their pervasion around the lower complex, these roots have grown over many decades, perhaps centuries, but their source was unknown. You left this chamber and continued north, and sent Sargo into the room beneath the thick wooden door. This was another garden, with another tree at its centre, much less sickly in appearance than the others before. Roots grew everywhere again, and between them stepped a pair of skeletons who pruned the stalks of the fungi and squeezed the juice from the tree polyps. As they worked, one spotted the dust move abnormally, and creaked towards the hidden Sargo. Rachel snapped her familiar away from the mortal world for a time. Bragi resolved to do away with these things, and both you and Fair charged in, smashing one apart into shards of bone, and chasing down the other, which ran as Erky Timbers brought forth his symbol of The Watchman. But you found the way ahead; a stone door marked with runes led off to the south west. As you stepped towards it, the roots grasped at your feet here and there, but you shook them off easily enough, and gathered with Pryce and the others at the carven stone door.","Sargo was sent beneath it. The familiar saw into a long corridor that opened into a large room with a round side wall, an apse of sorts, in which sat a towering draconic statue of tinted blue marble. A dim red glow lingered in its open jaws, casting long shadows around the room. Nilsen grew tired of listening to Rachel explain what she saw, despite her excellent vocabulary. You opened the door, and strode in to face the dragon statue. This shrine had a carved runic tile set in front of it, just below the dragon’s jaws. Pryce, hearing of the runes, rushed in with wild eyes. You stood behind the flagstone and saw that it read ‘Let the sorcerous power illuminate my spirit’. As the others began to file into the room, you braced your feet, told your unseen servant to stand by, and blasted off eldritch lightning at the statue. Nothing happened. You fired off another cantrip, still nothing. Bragi asked what the runes said, and you told him. As you finished the words, the dragon’s mouth erupted with orange flame, engulfing you. As you stand in the flames, you feel inspired, an afterglow of warmth. As you step off the tile, the shadows behind the statue begin to move."]},{heading:"And Back to Being Ambushed",image:"./img/shadow-creature.webp",paragraphs:["Erky Timbers and Rachel held off entering the shrine room. Looking at the orange glow from the room, you both missed the roots as they tightened around your ankles. Seconds later, you were both held fast, and two humanoids made from roots and vines stood from the growths beside you. Erky took a clubbing blow that almost knocked him out, but he was free at last and fled the room back into the hallway to the gardens. Risvinn and Agis turned from the enflamed Pryce and assaulted Rachel’s attacker. Rachel disappeared in a puff of mist, reappearing beside Erky, as seen through your familiar’s eyes and unrestrained by roots.","Nilsen turned to lend his sword, but watched the shadows of the room grow, even as the flames receded around Pryce. They formed into vague humanoid shapes, and crept along the walls to stand beside you, Bragi, and Pryce. One struck Bragi with a soul-chilling claw, draining you of your strength. But your blade was mastered by agility, not merely force, and you darted back behind Nilsen and Agis. Agis looked around and saw his escape cut off, and whispered to Aeladh before your feet became a blur of movement. You darted under the grasping claws of the shadows, back through the vine blights, and stood near Rachel and Erky. As you moved, your blade passed through one of the vine creatures, splintering shards of root from it. Pryce backed off behind Nilsen, who heard a whispering in his mind, and in a moment of inspiration you held out the driftglobe, rolled it into the midst of the shadows, and commanded it to burst into daylight. From their dark corners they shrieked as only malevolent spirits might, and flailed wildly at Nilsen and Bragi again. Pryce’s unseen servant got in the way of one, and was destroyed by its passing. But Pryce almost doubled over in mental anguish as your patron’s emissary, Vulthoom, was gripped by the vine creatures in the adjacent room, and perished. The other humanoid stepped into the room of shadows and trapped the fleeing Izbolk, your goblin guide, felling him with crippling slam of its branch-arm.","Nilsen pressed into the swirling mass of shadows, using the daylight to pick each one out. You hacked at one, cleaving through it and dissipating its necrotic evil. Agis darted out and sliced into the injured vine blight, and Risvinn finished it off with a brutal chop. Rachel now returned from hallway with Erky, and smashed the other damaged blight with your stones. Both now fell, and you could see the light and shadows reach out from the doorway to the shrine room. Agis described the scene to the terrified, and badly injured Erky. He stood as tall as his halfling size allowed, and brandished his symbol of Vigilance, He shouted at the top of his voice, and banished all three remaining shadows, forcing them to fall back behind the shrine statue in the next room. Bragi, Nilsen, and Pryce piled in, harrying the undead abominations in their hiding places, and as they were destroyed, the recesses of the room became brighter, and the air less chilled. Finally, the last of them gone, you let your weapons fall from limp arms, and you relaxed for a moment. You gathered back in the shrine room, and saw each other battered and injured, so you agreed to rest here, heal, and figure out where Sharwynn and Maynard had gotten to down here.","You checked under the next door to ensure nothing dangerous hid there as you rested.Pryce used the last of his brimstone to summon Vulthoom once more, and both lept from their rest at the news that the room next door, free from foes, held a library...","You rested, and having healed your wounds sufficiently, you gathered up your gear and readied in the library. Your watches were mostly quiet. Pryce could not be held back from the library, and his red-ringed eyes tell of a man who is accustomed to lack of sleep and reading in the night. But during the middle watches, you heard echoes through the complex; guttural, deep rumbles here, clanking metal there, and now and again, the shifting of some vegetation."]},{heading:"A vine mess you've gotten into",paragraphs:["Agis and Bragi did a thorough job of making the door beyond the library safe. Pryce spent time pointing out interesting passages, some concerning dragons, others the citadel in which you rested, and the cult that built it. He had to be pulled away from the tomes, but as you opened the door he could be seen stuffing many into the folds of his robes and his pack. The door beyond led to a set of steps and a short passage blanketed by hanging vines and roots from above and through the walls. Some seemed to come from through the floor above, perhaps the dying tree in its arboretum, but most through the walls over the passage. Fair locked a shield in place, readied your sword, and pressed ahead into the curtain of vines. You brushed past them, feeling sickly fungal spores drop onto your armour and to the ground, but once through the vines did not hang back naturally. They curled up, and fell to the ground as one large mass. The mass became humanoid in shape, and ahead, at the top of a similar staircase to that you descended, stood another shambling mass of roots and vines. Some formed a face, so fair decided to speak, asking if there was not a bloodless way to reach their shared goals. The face responded with the voice of an elderly man, but firmly reminded Fair of the destruction they had wrought in place of a bloodless way thus far. Both humanoids pressed on both sides of Fair, and so the others had seen enough.","Risvin and Nilsen both piled forwards, through the vines, and into the flank of the shambling husk. It appeared not to notice the damage they wrought on it, nor that of Agis’ blade as it tore out a large mass of roots. And it made no noise as you all followed it to Fair with ceaseless attacks, falling as it was about to strike the paladin. The other struck Fair with a firm slam of an appendage, which Fair responded to with a flaming rebuke that almost burned it to the ground. Your silvered sword shattered charred vine and chopped the creature to its end. No wail or voice accompanied its death.","You ascended the stairs and slowly reached a corridor lined with alcoves. Within each alcove sat a draconic statue, and in between each alcove was a wall sconce for a torch. But for now, your driftglobe provided all the light in this dim passage. It turned south, and the long corridor gave Agis pause. He meticulously checked, step by step, ahead of the party. After some time, you reached the end of the long passage. Apart from the sickly roots, vines and immobile dragon statues, nothing threatened you. But two doors led east, neither of which revealed any sounds of what lay behind.","Sargo crept under a door, unseen to all eyes. Rachel perceived a room beyond, with orderly shelves, books, and a table laid with notes and scroll tubes. The floor was mossy and covered in soil, with a few stalks rising from it. Before the imp could look any closer, one of the stalks reached out and grasped at it. Another took form behind the table, and prepared to slam down on the centipede form. Sargo lashed out, stinger missing the vines, and it disappeared as its presence in this world was extinguished. Rachel lost sight of the room. But this didn’t matter to the others, who charged in, led by Fair. The paladin assaulted the first vine blight, followed by Nilsen and Risvin. Agis notched a bodkin and struck into the other abomination, and Bragi’s bolt sliced deeper into it. Both creatures soon fell under the weight of axe and greatsword.","Rachel stood in the corridor outside, checking the other door with Erky whilst the others investigated the room. Pryce mused over a tome, written in draconic, as Nilsen and Fair picked through the drawers of the desk, finding hundreds of gold coins. Risvin and Bragi trawled the bookshelves, finding some interesting scrolls. Pryce, fixated on the book, leafed through to a page that came alive with black symbols. He was transfixed. And then the book exploded in a shower of spores, a cloud of poison that engulfed everyone in the room. Choking and bleary-eyed, you recovered to see Pryce looking sheepish, still flicking through blank pages, confused. Agis, who avoided the worst of the spores, put his ear to the door in this study. You checked with Rachel, and feeling a slight breeze under both doors, realised it was likely to the same room she stood at the door of. You simultaneously opened both doors."]},{heading:"The Grove Gate",image:"./img/tree-creature.webp",paragraphs:["The chamber beyond was strewn with goblin supplies and vines. But its southern wall had collapsed. The citadel wall opened into an immense cavern, dimly lit with fungi and lingering, violet spores. It was overgrown with six-seven foot high vines and sickly weeds, blocking your vision beyond, but above this, in the distant violet haze you saw crumbling towers poke out, and weeds growing up the pillars into the violet-speckled cave ceiling beyond. A nearby tower would afford a vantage point, but before you could assess it for danger, one of the nearest vines sprouted, becoming humanoid, and spoke.","It addressed you angrily and wearily, but answered questions you had, explaining how Belak had tended things here in the grove. It told how Belak allowed one apple into the surface, to grow the vine creatures, who would return here. At times it answered you as if it were Belak, others in the third person. But it then explained how Belak was not yet ready to let an apple go, not until Gulthias had its feast. The apple may be released in good time, but the price was half of the party, who should remain here to serve, as Belak serves. You reminded the creature of Maynard and Sharwynn, whom you tracked here. The voice appeared to remember them. Yes they were here too. So it beckoned that you decide. Whilst you chose, his archers would ensure they maintained target practice. With that remark, eight goblins armed with shortbows sprang up from behind the crumbling tower nearby, and opened fire.","The arrows rained down, peppering Risvin and Nilsen. Fair braced her shield and charged up the spiral stairs to the upper level, arriving as the goblins hid behind the wall, and away from sight from the rest of your party. Only you could see them, so they turned and loosed a volley of arrows into you thick armour. But all armour has weaknesses, and your was no different. You fell under the hail of bodkins, bleeding from wounds beneath the mail coat. But as you fell, a pall of darkness covered the tower. Rachel held it there as Bragi sent a swirling cloud of knives into the dark and you both listening as the goblins panicked amid a horrid slicing of flesh and bone. As Fair bled and slowly died, Nilsen and Erky raced to the top of the stairs, bumping into goblins in the dark and hacking where they stood. Risvin, Pryce, ad Agis took aim, waiting for the darkness to fall and a target to step into their sight. But the stumbling goblins panicked; some walked into the cloud of daggers again, others into the waiting blade of Nilsen, and another off the edge of the stair. Once their positions were exposed, Rachel lifted the blanket of night, and your party rained bolts, longbow shafts, and lightning into the remaining goblin archers. The misbegotten creatures perished, almost to a greenskin, whilst Nilsen held one against the wall, ready for execution. Erky placed his healing hands on Fair, and helped you to your feet again, as Nilsen placed his hands around the neck of the goblin and relieved it of the burden of life.","You stepped looked out across the top of the vine forest, and saw in the distance how the glowing moss and fungi illuminated a dark shape, a tree of sorts, that loomed high over the rest of the growth. Seeing this, Pryce lurched for a second, seeing the tree amidst a vision of something terrifying. You seemed to the others to pause, horrified for a moment, and only returned to the present after extreme exertion of will.","You shared with the others what you saw: A tree, dark and looming, in a violet haze, with long roots extending down and into a hole in the earth, a portal of utter darkness that swallowed all life and light. And around this portal was a ring of symbols, etched in brightest silver. And these symbols swirled around the opening. And they were as those on your brands. You saw into the pit, and only managed, with great effort, to save yourself from being pulled in.","Fair remained at the top of the tower, watching over the top of the thicket of vines and weeds, joined by Rachel, whose sight rarely faltered. Agis stepped to the edge of the sickly brambles, and saw hidden there a forest of nasty thorns and razor-sharp spines on the vines and weeds. But you found a pathway, likely used by the goblins, that provided a safe passage through. And so, in single file, you led the others through, connected by a length of rope."]},{heading:"Through Thicket and Thin",paragraphs:["Each of you carefully followed Agis, keeping to his exact path, and trying not to panic at the sounds of movement from elsewhere in the cavern. Rachel watched you weave your way into the middle of the thicket. From the recesses of the cavern you spotted the vine-tops swaying, as three creatures converged on the line of party members. They moved slowly, but unerringly, towards the head and centre of the line, so you shouted out a warning. The party readied blades and spells. Pryce’s wild eyes darted here and there, and the moment the creature burst from the thicket you were ready to blast it with lightning. Riswynn rushed to your aid, hacking at it, chopping shards of bark with your axe. Soon Bragi was set upon too, and Nilsen was on hand to aid you by carving it into driftwood. At the head of the line, Agis’s blade quivered, and you reacted fast to strike unerringly up into the onrushing vine creature. Within moments, the creatures were a mass of dead vines on the ground, and you pressed onwards, nursing a few more injuries.","Rachel stepped down from the ramparts, leaving Fair to ensure the coast was clear and leave open an escape route. You scurried into the brambles, and followed the route of Agis. Agis turned you all around and was instrumental in keeping you moving through the brush in the right direction. By the time Rachel caught up, you all passed out the other side of the thicket. And into a lofty area of the cavern. Amid the sharp intake of breath, Riswynn and Nilsen guzzled down a potion."]},{heading:"The Gulthias",paragraphs:["The ceiling, glistening with violet fungus, picked out the dark branches of a huge and ancient tree. Its knotty trunk twisted as it rose from the bedding of roots and vines at its base to the grim and foreboding appendages that looked like they might slam down on you at any moment. Pryce gazed at the tree, seeing your vision come to life in a way that stunned and horrified you. But something was different; no rune-ringed pit, no roots descending, as if the sight of such a malevolent mangrove wasn’t bad enough. But it was Agis who connected the sight of this horror to the deeper sense of dread here; he explained that this tree was an Elven Kalenuraa. These legendary trees are said to have grown throughout the elven world before the First Sin, growing between worlds to this day. But high up in its boughs was a single apple.","You gathered your senses. Bragi, out of the corner of his eye, noticed a large feline creature crouching behind a nearby ruin, ready to pounce. Agis spotted another figure, standing behind the tree, with a warped staff in hand. But in front of them, fully armoured in thick chainmail and heraldic shield, stood a knight. This was evidently Ser Maynard, which meant that the hiding figure behind the tree must have been Belak. But Sharwynn was nowhere to be seen. Belak began to speak, but his words came out of a vine creature that stood alongside Maynard.","He asked that you bear witness to the Gulthias Tree, which grows from the Ethereum to this world. But now that you have seen it, you cannot be allowed to leave here and bring others, not without submitting to Belak. But the deal still stood; he offered that you leave here and allow half of your number to remain as thralls of the Gulthias, when the apple is ready. But that would take a long time, perhaps months."]},{heading:"The Battle of the Depths",paragraphs:["You looked at one another, agreeing that this abomination should not survive, and to take the applefrom its cold, dead branches. Nilsen moved to rush forward at the hidden predator in the ruins, but the air began to sing with metal. Daggers filled the area you all stood within, sending shards of metal into your armour and clothing. Nilsen sprang out, as a female figure appeared from hiding behind a further ruined wall. Belak cursed, taking cover behind the Gulthias. Rachel ran from the hail of knives and pointed at the female. Her red hair gave away her identity; Sharwynn Hucrele of Oakhurst. But now she panicked at the whispers Rachel implanted in her mind, and hid behind the ruined wall deeper into the cavern, chased by one of Bragi’s poisoned bolts. The primeval tiger behind the other wall lept out at Riswynn, knocking you down and clawing savagely at your torso. You quickly got up, and aided Nilsen in hacking it back into the cavern.","The speaking vine beast drew up beside you, slamming its arms down onto you, before it was lit up by psychic lightning from Pryce, cackling gleefully. Now Nilsen pulled up briefly, his armour growing quickly searingly hot and burning his skin and hair. Bragi looked at Sharwynn, Belak and Maynard, who was now rushing across the room to aid the tiger. Their skin was rough, bark-like, and their eyes glossy and pitch black. They looked like those of the vine-creatures. They were thralls of the Gulthias, and so the Gulthias must be destroyed. You shouted to Nilsen and Riswynn, who turned towards the tree and exhaled their potions, spewing a gout of flame over the Gulthias Tree, threatening to set it alight. Belak raged behind the tree, and wrapped himself in a cloak of bark armour. Agis backed off, keeping space from the others to avoid getting caught in more dagger-filled clouds. His arrows found their mark in the hide of the tiger. But Riswynn’s axe hit home more assuredly, and the tiger staggered off for a moment, before collapsing and then simply disappearing back to the realm it came from. Maynard was now up to both Nilsen and Riswynn. He drew a longsword of dark metal, an ancient thing, and with expert martial prowess he batted aside the parries and struck into Riswynn, injuring you mortally, before turning to Nilsen. Sharwynn now returned to the fight, and sent off a volley of unerring green arrows from her fingers towards Bragi. The bard already badly injured, fell to the ground. Your numbers were thinning; the thralls of the Gulthias were in the ascension.","Rachel looked up at the tree, and set her face in a fury. You picked a flask of oil from your pack, and hurled it at the tree, coating the upper portion of the trunk, and yelled at Nilsen. But Belak stepped forward, armed with his staff. He stepped towards Nilsen, and a cloud of spores pulsed from his body, swirling around him. He twirled the staff but you avoided his blow, and found another opening to blow a cloud of flame at the trunk, sending the whole tree aflame. Belak gasped in horror, and stepped back to lay his hands on the tree to stop the flames spreading. This left Erky Timbers the halfling a chance to uncord a healing potion and restore Bragi. Sharwynn saw this and attempted to charm the bard, sending a crown of madness over your head, warning the others to stay away lest you attack them. So they did, and you rushed forward with rapiers drawn, striking Sharwynn once through her bark-skin. She put a step between you both, and sent a burst of flame from her fingertips that once again had you on your back and unconscious. Maynard had Nilsen marked, and issued a challenge that Nilsen could not (even if he wanted to) reject as you frenzied. But the knight was equal to your strikes, and took them well. He saw an opening and sliced through your breastplate, giving you a mortal wound. But Maynard’s advantage was short-lived.","Pryce appraised the scene, and realised your strongest warriors were either unconscious or badly injured, whereas their group was at full strength, with a vine-creature still guarding the tree from direct assault. You own arsenal of weaponry was at its limit. But you recalled the scroll from Belak’s study, pulled it from its tube, and unfurled it. The runes virtually read themselves. The tall knight stood motionless, held in place by your spell, and the tide instantly turned.","Agis, standing by, to offer healing to Riswynn. The dwarf soldier got up, you stepped back from the knight and Belak, clove the vine-creature in two, and breathed more fire over the Gulthias. It now began to buckle in the middle, the apple swaying high above. Rachel looked up, and then back down at the stones in your hand. Sharwynn closed in on you, and Belak’s spores strafed tiny poisonous cuts into Agis. You took aim at the base of the tree, and sent one stone at it, chipping part of the blackened truck away. So you aimed a second at the same place, a weak point of the perennial. It struck home. You heard a sickening snap, and then more, and the light from the cavern ceiling changed, as the huge top of the tree collapsed down into its base, breaking branches and sending a column of flaming wood into the air. The Gulthias Tree was destroyed."]},{heading:"From the Ashes",image:"./img/gulthias.webp",paragraphs:["Belak stopped, horrified for a moment, and then collapsed too. As did Sharwynn, and eventually Maynard. Belak and Sharwynn’s eyes returned to normal. The knight’s helm concealed his eyes but he seemed to pacify too. But then they all began to cough, and up came horrid black and bloody bile. Sharwynn cried for help. Beside her Bragi’s blood covered the cave floor. You were almost dead. Rachel cried out for someone to heal you, and Belak rolled over, extended his arm, and used his final healing spell an instant before you passed. Agis came to his side, and he whispered with his dying breath to fetch his goblins; they would know the method which could cure Sharwynn and Maynard of their thraldom, without which they would die. And with that, Belak’s own life ended.","Pryce stumbled through the embers of the Gulthias, finding a well-protected bole of the tree that held its treasures. But more than that, he found the restorative apple at last. Its healing power would restore Lord Aldred’s son, and the lives of Maynard of Ashford and Sharwynn Hucrele. Riswynn ran to fetch the goblins, and expected to climb the shaft to the level above. But you got to the workshop on this floor and found it guarded by Grenl’s warriors. Grenl had taken up residence now, and she gleefully appraised the goblin wine-making operation. She agreed to repay your mercy by letting the goblin servants make potions from the apple, but would keep the seeds of the apple for herself, as they would grow into lovely vine-creatures that could be of service to her. She thanked you for removing Belak, and said this was her domain now. Once your party was healed, you could return above. But, she finished, this place was hers now, and to return here would mean your death."]}],rg={title:og,sections:ag},ig="The Chosen of Ashardalon",sg=[{heading:"The End of the People of Yusdrayl",paragraphs:["While some of you rushed to seek the aid of the goblins to make the potions, the rest of you gathered the remaining treasures in the bole of the Gulthias Tree, the corrupted Kalenuraa, and hauled them back to the goblin lair. Grenl was happy to let you return above with Sharwynn and Maynard, but would ensure you could not trouble her any longer. There were many ways to the surface from here, and dark passages led into the deeper caverns of the underdark. And so, when you were ushered back up the shaft to the citadel above, her shamans collapsed the shaft room and the way back down into the grove level.","You got clear of the wreckage, and picked your way through the empty goblin lair, discovering that Yusdrayl’s kobolds had begun to scout the chambers out and also found it empty. You bypassed the earlier passageways and found the boulder had been removed from the short-cut passage between Yusdrayl’s lair and that of Durnn. Whilst Fair fell down yet another pit trap, Agis overheard the kobold scouts drinking goblin wine nearby, so time was running short to avoid bumping into the kobold forces headed your way. Riswynn used her new blade, shatterspike, to break apart the doors with ease, allowing you swift passage towards Yusdrayl’s chamber. Rachel guessed that Yusdrayl may not be with her kobold army, and if not, would not be so well defended. And once you found the boulder gone between  lairs, you realised you stood in a room you’d last been in two days before, right next to the kobold lair. ","You swung open the door, and found the throne-room, this time guarded by only a few elite guards, and three robed sorcerors alongside the throne. But instead of a massive troll, there sat only a kobold wearing white robes and with an expensive ring. An armed servant spotted you first, but could do little to avoid the onrushing Riswynn. She would have vengeance for Meepo. ","Riswynn sliced the guard from shoulder to hip, dropping him. Rachel scurried in, and saw Yusdrayl in her true form, gasping at your surprise attack when she was poorly defended. You aimed the wand at her, and pummelled the kobold leader with a volley of magic missiles from your new wand. Yusdrayl quickly lept off the throne and ran for cover, turning invisible as she did so. Nilsen tried to follow but was cut off by one of her guards, who took a javelin to the chest as it sliced your armour. Pryce felt the darkness well within and summoned a darkness to taste, gnaw, and devour the kobolds around the throne. It blackened the area around the throne, to the screams of the kobolds within, and nothing got free of it. Agis notched a pair of arrows and killed another guard, as Fair’s blade tore apart the other, leaving only one that stood toe-to-toe with Nilsen. Agis, Fair, and Riswynn moved around the passages south to cut off the fleeing Yusdrayl, and Agis flung a hail of caltrops ahead of you all to ensure she couldn’t easily flee past without injury. Pryce sent a storm of lightning at the remaining kobold guard, pushing it back, and giving Nilsen space to bring his greatsword swinging through the air for a clean, ‘all-flesh’ decapitation. And as the kobold’s head hit the ground, a horrifying, pallid white tentacle grasped it and pulled it into the black pit made by Pryce, who felt the satisfaction of his master. Rachel looked into the gaping maw of darkness left by Pryce, her young eyes barely able to comprehend the thing that devoured everything living. But you stepped closer to it, to know more of this thing, to the consternation of the others.","Riswynn joins Fair and Agis, followed by the bloodied Nilsen. But as you turned the corner to box-in the kobold queen, she appeared at the end of the corridor, her hands erupting with a ball of searing flame at you all. Fair dropped instantly, but you charged through it, followed by Agis. Erky Timbers, whose job it was to keep the weakened Maynard and Sharwynn safe, scrambled to assist. Pryce dragged Fair’s dying body from the flames, as another fireball tore through Agis and the others. Whilst Nilsen’s beard was almost ruined, Agis seemed to grow accustomed to the heat and flames, drawing them into yourself and suffering little. And when you spotted Yusdrayl appear once again, you sent her reeling with another pair of well-aimed shafts.","Now Riswynn stood alone with the kobold queen, and she taunted you, asking what became of her failure of an underling Meepo, hoping that he died in the belly of Calcryx before she perished. Riswynn’s crossbow bolt found its mark in reply, but Yusdrayl grinned and focused her power on the dwarf soldier. Until Rachel, who stood the other side of the devouring pit of darkness, hidden there, but fully perceiving through the kobold queen through it, whispered in Yusdrayl’s mind. And those whispers ran riot, driving her momentarily insane, and destroying her mind forever. Yusdrayl, Queen of the Kobolds, pretender to the dragon priests of Ashardalon, was dead. ","At that unfortunate moment, a band of kobold soldiers appeared, and saw that their leader was dead. They looked at you and decided to surrender. They would happily leave the citadel via the way they came to it many moons ago. You accepted this, and watched them squabble their way to the throne room, through a larder, and to a room where the wall had collapsed and opened into a tunnel that led deeper into the underdark. Perhaps, that would wait for another day, thought Rachel as you gazed into the unknown, and listened to the kobolds argue over which of them would be chieftain. ","The others raided the throne area, once Pryce had dispelled his well of tentacles, and found the throne to be made of pieces of a stone dragon altar. In the carven stone jaws was a key, brass and shaped like a dragon. So you took Yusdrayl’s treasure, and the dragon key, to the dragon-carved door located in the early rooms of the citadel. The door, the most ornate in the complex, accepted the key that Pryce turned, glistening with arcane energy for a moment as the wards are relaxed."]},{image:"./img/sentinel.jpg",heading:"The Sentinel",paragraphs:["Pryce pushed the door open. Beyond was a chamber, long-forgotten, that ended in an arched opening. Tiles on the floor and wall carried through both rooms, cracked and chipped from ages of decay. But the nearest chamber was lined with wall alcoves, and in each was a statue of a human. Some robed, some armoured, but all in stone and pointed at the middle of the room. Below the archway that divided the rooms was a pit, and from beyond it there glowed a green light. Pryce’s mind wandered as the light seemed to sing to him, and you all watched him slowly pass through the door, aimlessly walking towards the pit! Fair was the first to charge in and tackle Pryce to the ground, but you heard the song and were too drawn towards the pit. Nilsen, outside, could hear the faint chords of a song, but realised what was happening and stuffed rags into his ears before charging in and trying to tackle the paladin. And missed. Now Riswynn did the same, but also missed. You both stood at the edge of yet another pit, filled with razor-sharp spikes, and stopped there, as Fair heard Rachel’s voice in her head that blocked the song momentarily, and you recovered your senses. Nilsen stoppered the ears of Pryce before he could rise, and you stood in the room safely at last. ","The three of you stood in front of a large stone sarcophagus. Behind it lay a large suit of pitted and ruin brass armour. The lid of the sarcophagus was cracked, but on the ceiling above it, Pryce could see words, written in ancient draconic: ‘A dragon-priest entombed alive for transgressions of the Law still retains the honour of their position’. Reading it out sent a chill through your group. With a metallic scraping and faintly-audible groans, the brass armour assembled. It came to form an imposing brass quadruped, winged, but more like a ram than a horse. Dusty gas escaped from its nostrils as it towered over you, and stepped forward. Fair wanted nothing to do with this place, and went back across the pit. But both warlocks remained. It tried a few languages before settling on an archaic form of common. And, oddly, it spoke with a calm female tone, seeming despondent.","It explained that it had failed. When pressed, it said it had failed to guard this prison of the renegade dragon-priest Al’Phradeas, entombed here alive for breaking the laws of this citadel. Al’Phradeas had escaped, and had done so with the aid of a guardian. Like her, this guardian was a construct, an ancient thing crafted of silver, in the shape of an armoured knight, and bearing a long polearm weapon that defied her defences. The ancient brass sentinel was unable to leave the wards of this place, but now asked that, in return for the plunder of this tomb, you seek out and return here with the dragon-priest so that her watch might be ended. So you looked into the sarcophagus. There were several scroll tubes, and all but one held their spell scrolls. The sentinel saw it and remarked that the strongest of them had been taken, a shape-changing spell devised by priests who sought to walk freely among others. This dragon priest was free. ","You accepted the challenge, taking the other items, and left the dark ruins behind.

He stood away from the dark corner of the taproom so as not to be confused for some northern ranger or ill-met fellow. This was a man of Caer Camlyn, draped in a red and white cloak of House Caster.  He met the toast proposed by Garan and introduced himself. He was Bernardt, a trusted envoy of Lord Aldred. Bernardt was sent directly from Caer Camlyn to escort the cure for Master Aedann Caster. He would prefer if you came with him as further protection but such was its importance that he was instructed to take it regardless of your wishes. His letter of authority could command supplies, food and board, and even fresh mounts where required.","You agreed to go with Bernardt the following day, after a well-earned rest. Maynard would rest here and regain his strength, and Sharwyn reunite with her parents. Erky Timbers wanted to remain behind so hecould find out about his doppelganger’s actions and any trouble it caused.

The cargo of caged livestock, coal, tools, and lumber were all under tarpaulins. It was Agis who spotted that the barge had become dangerously lopsided, but the cargo and crew were balanced along its length. One crew member went to check the livestock, lifted the tarpaulin, and wailed, before collapsing beneath the cover.","The skipper went to check, and with your help, lifted the cover with an oar. Once lifted, there was a screech, and a flurry of feathers as three crazed cockatrices burst from beneath, catching you all off guard. One darted across the deck at Rachel, biting her on the exposed arm. A grey rot spread over your arm and up your body, dropping you to the deck as you slowly turned to stone. The barge tilted again, knocking Riswynn off his feet. ","The dwarf leant on his broadsword hilt and swung up at the beast's neck, glancing it. Agis cut another off before it could reach the skipper, marking its weak points, and driving blades deep into them, felling the horror in seconds. But they came on, even as Nilsen buried his claymore into the wings of the third cockatrice. It darted across the deck, biting and screeching, before Riswyn caught it between the wings with her sword. Rachel recovered before the petrifaction could take hold, got to her feet, and sent a psychic bolt into the pea-brain of the bird. It shivered, stunned, and reeled back against the gunwale. Price took aim, and blasted the thing up and over the rail, watching it sail across the surface of the river in a cloud of blood and feathers.","The skipper looked at the remaining cargo, including a stone pig, and thanked you for intervening before the whole crew and cargo were sent to the river bed."]},{heading:"Ashford",paragraphs:["Your skipper, Golith, spent the rest of the day clearing up the deck. As he pulled the tarpaulins from his livestock pens, he saw there nestled in their midst a woman in slightly tattered robes, cradling a spellbook. You questioned this woman, Nilah, who needed passage to Ashford on business. As one oarsman was still a statue, Nilah helped out as best she could to pay her way.","And as the sun went down the warm spring air and easy current made the trip upstream easy-going. You watched the silhouettes of the hillsides roll past, and god what rest you could before the morning. ","The next day, you began to pass into rugged ground, as the River Attley clove between cliffs on its way to Ashford. The skipper explained the reason Ashford was closed for weeks now, falling victim firstly to a plague, then a curse of the dead rising from their graves to assault the living. Only a dwarven cleric called Hjulner stemmed the tide, and found the source of the curse; an undead cleric vowing revenge on his colleague who merely cowered under the protection of the villagers.","Soon, you passed under the wooden bridge and arched stone bridge of Ashford, hoving the barge to the mill-side dock. Three main buildings dominate the village; the Jolly Farmer Inn, the Old Tower, and the Wailing Hall of the Peasant. The overseer instructs the dock hands, and you ask him about each one. He explains about the terrible plague that swept through the village, and how the two clerics tried to put it right. And of the wizard, Janela Fislefond, who lives in the Old Tower, and kept both the undead and begging villagers at bay with fireballs. The inn was your next stop, while Bernardt went to fetch fresh horses.","The Jolly Farmer had the appearance of a converted stable, with booths replacing pens either side of the central walkway, and a low roof supported by posts between the pens. The inn was quiet but busy, mostly with grim soldier-types who eyed each other with restrained emnity. You discovered that one group were retainers of Ser Godmund Elvery, lord of Firstwatch keep, and they were hardy warriors who fought orcs and their kind which hid in the moors of Carrick. Godmund was here to prevent the execution of his brother, Walder Elvery, who was recently tried and found guilty of murder of a fellow cleric and negligence in his defense of his flock. At another table were men of the Covenant court, who had pronounced judgement, and the headsman here to carry it out. You learned from them that Walder was brought to justice by one of your companions, Hjulner the dwarf. ","However, they struggled to find anyone to execute the criminal under the stare of Godmund and his men, and even the fellow sent from Caer Camlyn was intimidated by them.","Bragi left to find Hjulner to learn more, while Nilsen went to find Bernardt and see if he could talk some bravery into the headsman. Rachel and Pryce held back with Nilah, making it clear to everyone that this was not their fight. As the executioner left his seat with the three church militiamen, the men of Firstwatch rose too, and all left for the quickly-erected stage in the middle of the village.","Here, a few acolytes had arraigned Walder, head bowed in shame, and they were joined by the militiamen. They read out the long list of charges, and the villagers assembled, many crying or seething with anger. As the charges concluded, an armoured fellow roared that this was a sham, and that this village would do well to hand over the criminal to him, rather than blame poor Walder for all of their ills. He did not bring the plague, he was but a drunk, and for that he should be stripped of office. He turned to Nilah, asking her if she, a newcomer to town, could be objective and see what the angry villagers were blind to. You responded that death was too harsh a punishment, and the knight agreed. Everyone in the village watched, hands gripped around their meagre weapons and tools, as the knight and his retinue of perhaps fifteen men stood before the small execution party. Bernardt arrived, watching in horror as the headsman stood aside, and Godmund wrestled his brother's chains from the Covenant militia leader. He laughed at them, turning his back in contempt, and calmly led his men away. The impotent militia shook their heads that no-one in the village had the bravery to see justice done. ","Bernardt was angry, but as much at the headsman's cowardice as anyone else's. He reminded the executioner whose headsman he was, and promised a reckoning. Fed up, he turned to you all, and with fresh horses, you left Ashford to the bitter tears of its villagers."]},{heading:"Uncertain Motives",paragraphs:["You set off quickly from Ashford, taking the afternoon to make your way into the foothills East of the village.","Some of you took the lead with Bernardt, the others lagging back. There, he made small talk, before asking Riswynn what the party sought by letting brigands take the law into their own hands back in Ashford. He heard Pryce mutter about the books of Tarrowby, and his gaze fell on young Rachel. She concerned Bernardt, how one so young could harbour such sinister power. Nilsen shrugged.","As you passed through the rugged lands, Bernardt expressed more concern about the strength of Godmund Elvery of Firstwatch at Ashford. It would worry his master too.","Up ahead, Nilsen was first to spot the clouds turning dark. But as you drew up to the ridge of the next hill, you saw it wasn't the weather but smoke, rising from a cluster of farm buildings around a round tower on the next hilltop. A fire had begun. Bernardt explained it was the stables and farm of the Percers, loyal servants of his lord. He yearned to intervene, but the importance of the mission was paramount. It was Pryce and Nilsen who led the calls for a rescue effort, and you spurred your mounts onwards."]},{heading:"A Farm In Flames",paragraphs:["Nilsen arrived at the gate first, jumping off his mount which refused to go closer to the flames. You ran into the clearing in the middle of the three barns and the tower, and saw a woman screaming from the top of the tower, something inaudible. The fire had taken hold on one large barn, likely a stable block, and had almost engulfed another. Pryce came next, sending your familiar Valthoom to the tower to listen to the screaming woman. She was yelling for Alvin to come back. Rachel sent her a message to be calm into her mind and she stopped wailing. She responded, oddly, 'Alvin, if that's you speaking to me, come back and be safe.'","Riswyn followed Nilsen to the edge of one barn, and seeing the doors open and the barn empty, moved across the clearing to the well, where Bernardt inspected the pulley gear. Sargo could see the whole farm from its lofty flight, and could see the barn engulfed in flames had its gates open. Valthoom could hear the farming woman calling for two people, Alvin and Orville, and Valthoom could perceive a baby and a young girl inside the tower too, screaming at it. The woman moved to brandish a dagger so the familiar moved to the well. Rachel investigated the trees nearby to see if anything hid there, suspecting malevolent influences as always.","Nilsen could see into the flaming barn now, and saw two people. Whilst the flames kept him back, Sargo flew inside. There, it saw a teenager in charred farmclothes, and a man lying on the ground before him, coughing violently from the smoke and fumes. The boy reacted as if endangered by the invisible presence nearby and waved his arms to create three perfect replicas of himself. Time began to slow down, obvious only to those capable of using magic, and the mortal realm was  momentarily breached. The boy exploded with white light, blinding Rachel's familiar Sargo, before returning to normal. Riswyn charged in, avoiding the worst of the flames, and confronted the scene.","The man coughed and called on Riswyn to calm the boy, Alvin Percer. But Alvin pointed to the ground beside his father, Orville, where lay a sword. Orville had tried to attack his son for some reason, and the boy refused to be sent to the church or lord Aldred for tuition and safe training. Pryce attempted to compel Alvin to be calm, but nothing worked. Nilsen entered the barn, making the case to Alvin to stop this destruction. But he refused. Then, from the opposite gates darted a small incandescent creature, skin of charcoal and eyes burning with flame. Another peered around the side of the stable block near Rachel."]},{heading:"The Fire Rises",paragraphs:["The first imp grinned in glee as it ran at Riswyn, clawing at her armour and burning her skin. The other was blocked by Bernardt from attacking Rachel, who cast a spell of elemental defense over the Caer Camlyn herald. Time slowed again and Alvin burst with frenzied activity, firing off a torrent of magic missiles that seriously injured Riswyn, before throwing a flaming bolt at Nilsen, narrowly missing. Pryce, at the corner of the intact barn, got line of sight to the imp attacking Bernardt, and sent a blast of force that shattered it to ashes. Bernardt nodded in appreciation, before turning to Rachel and offering her thanks for the spell of protection. He saw in her eyes a flash of satisfaction, and saw an ally for the moment. He looked across at the slithering form of Valthoom on the wall of the well, its tentacles wrapped around an empty bucket. Bernardt and Valthoom met eyes and from that moment they were a team, hauling buckets of water and lobbing them over the gable of the barn before it could fully catch fire.","Rachel now tried her luck with the lad, as Sargo dashed back out of the barn's far door. But Alvin would not abate, so she struck a mind sliver which harmlessly shattered a mirror-image of the lad, while Nilsen wrapped a soaking rag over himself and waded into the flaming barn. There, he tried to calm Alvin again, but to no avail. Riswyn reduced the foes to choose from by cleaving one fire imp in two with a vicious slice, then turned to charge into the mirror Alvins. Alvin had enough of being manipulated, and twinned a mind-control spell over Riswyn and Nilsen. Riswyn remained true, but Nilsen began to see Alvin everywhere; at the well, beside him trying to talk to another Alvin, outside blasting flaming imps, everyone was Alvin. He had no idea which was real.","Pryce blasted out at a mirror image, striking one but missing another whilst toying with the idea of opening a portal to the Outer Realms for an outer dweller to feed on the contents of the barn instead. But Riswyn had enough, and struck out at the two remaining Alvins, shattering the final simulacrum and hacking into the delicate flesh of the real teenager. He screamed, and his concentration on Nilsen's nightmare was ended. The notherner flew into a brutal fury; his first strike sent Alvin reeling with a bloody cleave across the thigh, before catching his torso square on the upward cut."]},{heading:"Quenched",paragraphs:["Alvin fell to the ground. Nilsen tried to placate him, but sometimes there was no answer to such mania. The son of Niels watched with grim and stoic sadness as the young man died. As he did, the flames died down, and Riswyn lifted the father's arms angrily, dragging him out across the yard unceremoniously, and dumping him at the foot of the tower. She muttered about what kind of man bears arms against his own kin.","His wife emerged in tears, thankful for the return of her husband Orville. Riswyn grumbled as she gave him a healing draught, and Rachel asked Bernardt what would become of them. He looked at the blade on the ground, and the dead boy. Nilsen was already taking the corpse to a plot beyond the hilltop where he found a set of graves. Bernardt pronounced that his lord would have justice here, but also pity that they could not control their son's magical will. Such was the way of youth blessed with power over the Ethereum, but they should have sought aid sooner. His lord would want a penalty rather than a harsher sentence, but the true heroes were the party of the Broken Spear, and to them should rewards be bestowed.","Maireade Percer and her husband gathered some valuables; coins and some healing vials, wrapped up in a bag too small to carry it all. It was a bag of holding. Within were other items, silverware engraved with mysterious sigils and scenes of impossible geometry that interested Pryce. He demanded to know their origin, a wild look in his eyes. The Percers responded that they were heirlooms from a grandparent, Mordlay Percer, who settled in these parts. Pryce thanked them, and looked upon the heirlooms with almost too much affection.","But Orville was grateful to be alive. He wanted an end to magical influence on his house, so he gifted something to the keenest rider of the group. He took Riswyn to the stables. There, at the very back, was a strong gate. And within, there was a powerful, thick-limbed destrier. He had taken this animal in as he found it, origin unknown. But it was a reliable and valuable creature with an otherworldly look in its eyes. Despite the flames, it remained calm, and as it turned to view Riswyn, it stomped the earth in recognition of a new master. This was Blackmoon. ","And so, mounted on rested horses, with a new saddle on Blackmoon, you made back off on the track to Caer Camlyn as the sunlight faded.","You spent the day on the trail. Pryce quizzed Bernardt on the placename Galfell, from where the grandparent of Orville came, owner of the mysteriously-carven silverware. Bernardt has no idea, it was not a name he was familiar with. He detected a certain mania behind Pryce's questions, and rode on. Evening began to draw in.","As darkness fell, a frustrated Bernardt admitted they should seek shelter for the night. A woodland trail had grown into a deep trench, which Bernardt explained was an old river bed formed out of a trail of destruction once wrought by a beast of these parts, long since dead. To the north of that path, you spotted the ruins of an old cottage which could provide ample defence if needed."]},{heading:"The Not Entirely Abandoned Cottage",paragraphs:["Agis approached and spotted fresh tracks among the older carter and farmer ways, including a set of very deep hoofprints, much deeper than even Blackmoon's. Valthoom haunted across the night sky and through the broken roof of the crumbling stone building. There it spotted little, apart from three statues arranged in one corner of the main room. Nilsen stepped in too, spotting the signs of recent habitation, and warm embers in the fireplace. Nilah examined the statues while Bragi looked around for anything hidden. He spotted a loose floorboard that he prised up and within a puch were 20 gold crowns and two vials of healing. He heard a faint bell ringing as Rachel took out a wand and tested the room for more secrets. Nilah looked at the statues and a cold shiver ran down her spine; they were chipped and worn, but where the chips left a crack or a cove it was blemished with red staining. These statues once lived. In fact, their hands and feet were bound in rope that was also turned to stone.","Sargo had taken flight and both Valthoom and it were scouting across the treetops when Pryce was warned that 'something is coming; something so big it moves the trees'."]},{heading:"The Returning Patrol",paragraphs:["Agis took up a position at the edge of the tree line. There he spotted humans, a half-dozen, accompanying something big. It moved slowly and had to be led, resembling a huge bull, but with overlapping scales of metal as a hide. Its breath glowed green in the dim moonlight. You could hear them whispering commands to each other, aware you were there.","A vicious firefight ensued, as Nilah put half of the bandits to sleep as they lost control of the armoured bull. It charged forwards and blew a misty breath over the whole area, immersing Bragi, Pryce, and Nilah several times over. But you shrugged off the effects, which stunned you at first but threatened to petrify you, like the statues already in the shack. Other brigands darted between trees, taking cover to awaken their fellows. Nilsen, Nilah, Bragi, and Rachel focused their attention on the huge metal animal, stripping off parts of its hide piece by piece, hexing it, and adding to the accuracy of the barbarian's strikes. Nilsen staggered it, drawing its ire from Bernardt and also Rachel, who darted behind the shack to accompany Riswyn, Blackmoon and the horses.","Riswyn had secured the horses and was ready to join the fray, but her instinct warned her of unseen danger and she threw up a shield spell from her martial arcane tradition, and blocked the deadly blade of the brigand leader. The two slugged it out alone on the opposite side of the of the cottage, until Blackmoon charged in to defend its master, and Rachel gave him a piece of her warped mind. The bandit chief saw that his underlings were dropping to the unerring accuracy of Agis' bowshot and Pryce's force blasts, while their totemic bull-monster was being sliced up by the merciless cuts of Nilsen's greatsword.","At that moment the bull backed off and barged back through the trees, its black blood spattered across Nilsen and Bernardt's armour and blades. The other bandits, seeing this, began to flee, harried by your shots as they melted back into the woods. Their leader was already dashing through the undergrowth towards the deep river-bed track when he was dropped by a magic missile from Rachel's imagination. She liked the look of his dapper clothing, as did Riswyn. Leaping onto the back of Blackmoon, you rode the brigand down. You and Rachel divided up his spoils, while the others picked apart the belongings of his underlings. ","You let the others flee. Agis and Bernardt got to work making up the campfire and setting watches. ","The next morning you left the woods. Shortly, the rolling fields and grasslands offered a view of the road ahead as it curved towards foreboding black basalt cliffs that rose from a promontory near to a wide lake. Atop the cliffs was built a series of black towers, linked by a curtain wall that encompassed both a town and its keep. Bernardt spurred onwards, you had reached Caer Camlyn at last. ","The gatehouse guards stood aside for you and Bernardt, understanding of his errand, and riders parted the people milling around the fortress streets as you made speed for the keep barbican, up the ramp, through the double arches, and beyond the lower ward to the barracks. Bernardt took his leave whilst other guards escorting you on foot through the ornate chambers of the keep to the Great Hall. And here, aside the throne, sat the Chamberlain, Forral Godber. He thanked you for your efforts and applauded your success in bringing the apple. When you presented him with an already-distilled curative vial, he was suspicious. Rachel did little to allay those suspicions by offering to leave with the vial if it was unsuitable. The Chamberlain questioned you further, and from the arches behind his seat came a robed woman who verified your honesty. This was Gwen Redsparrow, mage and arcane advisor to Lord Aldred.","She opened a door to a series of small rooms behind the throne. Here lay the body of Lord Aldred Caster and his son Aedann, linked by a luminous ethereal chain. Lord Aldred's endurance was keeping his son alive, sacrificing himself to save his son. But it could not be sustained long, and gwen took the vial you offered. Forral Godber explained the lofty position you would hold if you saved the life of Aedann, and not to overreach for a reward. (edited)","The vial was emptied and the cure administered. Master Aedann opened his eyes, coughing wearily, and the Kingsthegn Aldred was released from his watchful sustenance of the boy. He blinked, looked around at you, and with something of a surprised scowl, asked 'Who in Aeladh's name are you?'."]}],ug={title:hg,sections:dg},cg="The Court of Aldred",fg=[{heading:"Made of Stars, and Made of Monsters",paragraphs:["The day began crisp, the sound of military drills around the walls of the fortress town. ","Rachel's night time excursions revealed a strange light from the peak of the mage Gwen Redsparrow's tower from time to time. You vowed to investigate, but only after a trip there. As it happened, both Pryce and a druid named Alestri were already in the tower; Pryce to devour the knowledge of Gwen's library, and Alestri to learn more of the land and its lord. Rachel met them both after entering via Gustaf, Gwen's servant. Sargo prowled up the outside of the tower, eventually reaching the top and seeing a window and shutter at the peak of the conical pepper-pot tower. The shutter opened after a few minutes, and then soon after, the window itself. Inside were odd instruments and Gwen Redsparrow herself. She looked at Sargo, and beckoned him inside, speaking to him as if he were a person, and not a crow. Then she realised, and left the strange room, going back to her library, and addressing Rachel directly. You were invited into the previously-locked room. All around were instruments used to measure the position and brightness of stars; you instinctively felt the importance of this, and an odd kinship with those very stars Gwen observed. And when you asked how they worked, Gwen was more than happy to explain.","Nilsen and Agis collected the items harvested from the beasts you defeated, and took them to the smiths of the fortress. There you procured a balanced crossguard and hilt for Nilsen's greatsword, crafted from dragon horn; the softer drake scales they had crafted into a supple cloak, and the scales of Calcryx were formed into a strong coat of scale mail, all able to withstand the might of a dragon's terrifying presence. The other dragon horn went to form a powerful longbow for Agis, and the Manticore spines a set of arrows that could pierce the toughest of hides.","Riswyn gathered her belongings and you found a quiet spot in the fortress. The walls should be more guarded than they were, so you found ample time and space to conduct a small ritual, bringing into being, for the first time, your new familiar. Shortly after, you rejoined the others, who were summoned to meet Lord Aldred, thanks to Agis' diplomacy with the Vallisaari emissary, Methild.","Aldred greeted you together, thanking you individually for your efforts, reminding you of the importance of Caer Camlyn to the defence of this realm. He walked the walls with you after confirming that he had written to Ardsere Mausel to allow you access to his archives. He produced a letter from the scribe Weylin, already in Tarrowby, who was overjoyed at the access he had already gained to the library. He promised to meet you upon your arrival in the town.","Aldred turned to his fortress and explained it could be held with half the number of soldiers he commanded, but his reach beyond its walls was limited by the meagre forces at his disposal. Trouble brewed in the West. Ser Harman Bryce of Elsewatch was well-armed and ambitious, sending only his sneaky halfling advisor to offer fealty at the feast of Vows many weeks earlier. Ser Godmund Elvery of Firstwatch was also a threat, honing his soldiers on the orcs and worse found among the Carrick Cairns. Aldred feared they might combine their powers and mount a campaign against Camelbourne. You explained the presence of a Drake beneath Elsewatch, and Gwen Redsparrow was shocked for a moment. The presence of a Drake, a gift from an old, powerful Dragon, to its vassals, told a tale of great danger. Rumours swirled that a dragon had made its home somewhere in the realm, but it was clearly smart enough, and powerful enough, to remain hidden. Other threats were in plain sight.","He brought from his cloak a refined blade, marked with a rune. Pryce recognised the rune as the same found on the scroll case from the Sunless Gorge. Khundrakar, it meant, and referred to a secret mountain-hollowed stronghold of dwarves. Aldred explained this blade was recovered from a scouting party of orcs in the West, and it was crafted in better fashion than those of his own smiths. He needed to know where these were being made. Such blades could be turned over to outfit his own men, and swing the tide of a battle against Bryce and Godmund, or prevent one at all.","But a promise was a promise, and that task would await their return from the Adsere's Archives at Tarrowby. You agreed, and Pryce marched off to find the Silversmith he gave a set of plates to earlier in the week."]},{heading:"Little Shop of Eldritch Horrors",paragraphs:["Pryce knocked on the door but no answer came. A few locals noted they hadn't seen the silversmith around in days, and he was rarely out of town. You decided to give it another day.","Returning the following evening with Valthoom and Alestri, Pryce asked around before knocking. No-one had spotted the smith, but they were sure he had a sign in the window yesterday. You had enough of waiting, and called for the others to keep an eye out while you popped around the rear of the shop. There, Alestri granted you the power to spider climb, and you ascended the yard wall to the unkempt garden and workshop yard. No signs of occupation. You darted up the main wall of the house and onto the roof; You needed a diversion to get past the guards on the roof, which Alestri provided. And while on the roof, Alestri became a ferret and followed you, sneaking to the chimney top. There were signs of a warm fire below, but maybe days ago. Someone was here recently, and wasn't answering the door.","Riswyn, Agis, Rachel, and Nilsen had arrived, and waited at the front door. You looked through the windows, and thought you saw someone. But knocking the door once more, no-one appeared. Nilsen was annoyed at someone stealing from you all, but remained calm. Rachel stood at the door and peered inside through the window, curiously whispering that she could pop in and have a look around. Barely had you affirmed her request, than she disappeared in a silver mist and reappeared inside the room. You looked around, seeing through the pitch blackness, and you stared into the empty shop, seeking out items of magical power. An object at the far end of the room glimmered for a moment. And you felt the presence of something nearby. Alestri in ferret form appeared, and sprinkled a veil of faerie fires around the room. And to your horror, there loomed over you both the figures of four grotesque shades - women in dresses and mourning veils - who whispered to you in a dark tongue.","Naturally, Nilsen had seen enough. He burst through the door and into the middle of the room.","Rachel ran, swapping places with Riswyn, who charged into the room, as Agis darted in to take the shade unawares, severing its link to the mortal realm in a few quick strikes. Nilsen opened the strap on his pouch, and rolled a globe onto the floor. There, he uttered the Huor word for daylight and the sunlight from his orb burned at the dark specters, including three more that had remained unseen until now.","You battled the creatures to and fro; their chilling claws injured your very souls, but they shrieked in the burning daylight each second they fought you in it. But one of their number fought with terrifying bitterness, reaching out of the doorway and into the moonlit street to chase after Pryce.

Once he was happy that everything was safe, he ordered everything to be carted to Tarrowby and the Silversmith's widow.","The Castellan realised this was a perfect chance for you to travel with his guards to Tarrowby, and to protect the cargo en-route. The following morning you set off. Pryce invested some crowns in a tailored brigandine of studded leather, and wore this beneath riding gear.

The ferry was working again, and doing brisk business. The fee was steep, but Nilsen contested a game of smoke rings with two of the boatmen. Despite the competition from the otherwise dim Big Lungs Bill, Nilsen wowed the waiting travellers with a surprising trio of smoke rings split by a single square smoke ring. The boatmen happily let you across, and made up their wagered loss by increasing the price for the remaining travellers.","Beyond the ferry, and into the afternoon, the track became a road again, and patrols of wardens nodded at the Camelborne men accompanying you. Other travellers greeted you politely whilst keeping a wary eye on your weapons. The road became busier, and soon you saw the spring sunlight glint off the spire of Tarrowby Cathedral, with its bright copper roof. You entered the westernmost gate, the Camlyn Gate, by late afternoon."]},{heading:"City Slickers",paragraphs:["The open square beyond the gate, signposted as Camlyn Square, was bustling with the usual sorts, and its width narrowed towards the main boulevard leading uphill. Nilsen immediately asked for directions and was confronted with a series of lefts and rights that made your head hurt. So you tried someone else. And then someone else. Eventually Riswyn intercepted a wandering cutpurse before he could make away with your coin, and chasing the would-be thief along the row of shops, the dwarf offered a coin for more reliable directions. And also a name - Revus - to mention in case you ran into trouble in the Warrens.","Everyone you asked about the Dead Herring seemed surprised that you could afford such an establishment. You turned up Coppersmith Lane to another square, and along a street parallel to the main Market Street, it ended at Toman Street. This street, known to Bragi, led uphill and away from Market Square, snaking East in line with the town walls. Unsure of the next steps, the frustrated Nilsen dew breath to ask a gentleman for the final time before going berserk. But Pryce dusted himself down, donned his spectacles, and took over. The gentleman, Gerald, laughed at your terrible jokes but happily showed you the way, begging you pass greetings to the delightful Calli, the proprietress. Enduring a series of posh puns, you both bade farewell to one another, with likely equal parts disdain and relief.

She chatted briefly about your trip, noted your delightful diversity, and laughed when you mentioned Gerald. She discussed his knack of leaving people wishing they were dead after ten seconds of his 'wit', and took payment for four rooms, including stabling, for an eye watering rate. But you could bathe, and avail of the perfumed soaps in each room. Luxury. And when you returned to the taproom for a drink, you all looked in excellent shape, notably Nilsen, who combed his beard and hair sharply to one side in a brave effort to look smart. Calli loved it, and nobody else was brave enough to say otherwise to the seven-foot Huorman.","You drank and ate. The local dish was a spicy sausage, called a pudding, and the Dead Herring specials board proudly declared 'This One's Dead!' for some reason. The patrons were polite, lower noble types; the kind that didn't have this kind of luxury at home. And then the door opened and in walked Weylin, bundles of papers stuffed under his arm. His spectacles steamed up as he greeted Calli with a bow and a blush. She pointed up to your table, and he dashed up the steps to the balcony level and hugged each one of you in turn.","He then went on to explain that he was able to access the library at last, and that he had met the Ardsere in person. But there was a mystery: several volumes relating to important topics, like family histories and heraldry, although referenced in other books, were absent from the library. Discussing the matter with the librarian drew ablank too. Some books had been removed. Furthermore, after meeting the guildmaster of the Chandlers Guild, Juanti Lieu, he discovered that their dies for signet ring casting had been removed from the vault by the Ardsere's men. They feared someone - perhaps even you - might try to steal them. But that wasn't all he discovered. Days after meeting the Guildmaster, he was approached in the street by someone with an ill disposition, who explained that access to the Ardsere's library was a rare thing, and had value to his people. He could be found at his workshop on the Middle Ring most days if what he had to say was of interest. And Weylin met others, who explained the origins of an odd festival each year, the significance of the pudding joke, and told him the Ardsere's archives could help solve a family history.

Clapping her hands she got to work, picking out a fur-lined cloak for Agis, a high-collared samite doublet and top hat for Pryce, and a fitted doublet in ivory brocade for Nilsen. Riswyn kept her armour, but you picked out some pieces to add to it. Sadly these were ornamental decorations for a coach, but you were undeterred. Marial paired these with silver silk, which made Riswyn reflect almost every inch of sunlight that hit her. Nilsen was happy with his clothing, and you picked out a hunter's hat to top it all off.

The precinct was accessed by a staircase that rose from the Market Square and King's Square, and it was a peaceful place high above the town, with formal rows of ash and lime trees. The Cathedral was imposing, moreseo because of its position atop the town than its size. A tall nave supported from two buttressed aisles was ended in a large stained glass rose window and topped with a copper roof that shone across the surrounding region in the sun. From within you could already hear chants and singing as the service had begun.","Each of you attempted to follow proceedings as best you could, despite you varying experience with the rites of a Covenant ceremony. Agis kept you all correct, barring occasions when Nilsen remained standing when you should kneel, or the clanking of Riswyn's armour on the flagstones.

He had not yet looked up as he asked you why you wanted his library, but when he did, the thickset features, grey hair, and steely stare reminded you this was as much a soldier as a cleric before you. He was direct, and gave the confidence of a man who did not need to care for your reaction. He walked you through the Cathedral again, flanked by guards and his attendants. You noted that fewer people accompanied the lord of the shire; this was also a man who enjoyed the trapping of authority.","Agis was pushed to the fore. You explained that some books had gone missing from the library, which he said you should direct to his librarian instead of the chief cleric of the region. But you also questioned the disappearance of the moulding dies from the Chandlers' Guildhall. He replied that he ordered the dies taken to a safer place in his vaults to avoid their theft. But he spoke highly of your impact on the realm; a civil war had been avoided thanks to your heroism to save Aldred's heir. You had earned the right to question these things, if you needed them. But Mausel admitted he also needed them, and to study them. He had discovered a branded pattern on several prisoners that the normal texts had not revealed to him. Possibly the original and historic dies would yield answers instead. He would keep them for two more days, and then seek your aid if his divination revealed nothing.

He returned with tea for you all. He placed a book in Pryce's lap, and pointed to a line of text. This book could not be found in libraries of the town, he said, for it was a prescribed text; heretical to even own. But he and his fellows were seekers after clarity, reason, and banishment of idle superstition. When questioned, he was unsurprised some books were missing from the library, but it was not he who took them. Rather they might be removed for repair or they might also have some heretical messages in them. In such events they could be kept in the vault beneath the Cathedral - oh you didn't see anything? - but likely the world will never see them again. Faliver guessed there might be other texts that he and his fellows could make use of down there, bring clarity to the people, and force the Covenant to admit to the contradictions in An B'Aelathil.

Here you got a close up look at the Tower of Penance, a soaring pillar of granite topped with an unlit brazier. The bridge linking it to the town was lined with statues and heavily guarded. You weren't entirely sure what the tower held, but few people here spoke of this place as anything other than ominous. A place of repentance, they called it. They didn't clarify if it was voluntary.","Sargo wheeled back up, unable to see anything beyond a few nesting spots. Perhaps there was something hidden under the river, but it could see nothing from here. So you went back to the Ardsere's Courtyard, but again the library was still closed. Guards kept watch to ensure no-one tresspassed, but Pryce managed to shuffle off Valthoom into the well to check down there. The tentacled horror slithered down, enjoying the slippery walls as it hit the water. Riswyn slipped over theatrically to mask the sound of the splash. But the nearby guard saw your simulation and blew his whistle, threatening to take action if Riswyn's foul action continued. Vatlhoom returned back up the well, having slightly spoiled the water with her presence, but found no way to get below ground from there."]},{heading:"Toilet Humour",paragraphs:["So your next port of call was the Cathedral itself. The guards of the precinct kneeled to say hello to Rachel, teasing her with a coin trick. Until Sargo emitted a days' worth of excrement from her raven form onto the guard. His partner almost fell laughing, and Rachel grabbed the coin - a platinum sovereign. As the guards departed to clean up and spread the hilarity, you walked into the Cathedral precinct again. The concourse, elevated above most of the town, was quiet as usual, with only a few monks and solitary citizens engaging in quiet contemplation. You examined the front door of the church, finding it understandably locked but unguarded. After finding the rear doors guarded by heavily-armoured Aegir and unmoved by Rachel's pleading, Sargo was called upon once more. ","The creepy familiar scaled the cathedral wall, popping in through an open window, and spotted a young cleric in the midst of cleaning. Progressing deeper into the empty nave, the now-invisible rat Sargo spotted a set of keys on one of the church prayer stools. Sargo noisily and visibly dragged the keys away, chased by the acolyte out a side door and into a cloister. Snapping invisible again, Sargo waited by the door for the acolyte to search the cloister gardens and darted back inside. There, Rachel appeared in a puff of mist, took the keys and opened the door for Riswyn, Pryce, and Nilsen to enter, before locking up again."]},{heading:"Suspense Drama",paragraphs:["Riswyn looked at the two large chandeliers and examined the stonework of the thick columns, finding part of them to be hollow. You climbed the metal stair to the clerestory above, looking along between the arches down at the nave below. Here, Nilsen, Rachel, and Pryce examined the nave, and saw a gap in the floor that suggested the steps up to the altar could move. Up above, Riswyn located hollow panels in the columns that had metal cranks within. They seemed attached to chains rising up, and the only other chains nearby were those that suspended the huge metal chandeliers with their brazier centrepieces. There were four cranks in total, and four of you. But turning cranks and lowering braziers might be noisy; no place for a nosy cleric. So when the acolyte returned, the door opened, and Nilsen's fist awaited the poor preacher. Nilsen dragged him to a pillar, bound his hands and feet, and went upstairs to attend a crank handle.","You all began to work a crank on each corner of the transept. They each maneuvered one step from the raised altar to form a step down below it. So some handles only worked after others were completely turned. But quickly, it was obvious something was amiss. Dust began to fall from above the transept, where the gallery rose to the bell-tower, and a dark shape silently descended on stone-grey wings. It was humanoid, bearing a dull green halberd and clad in verdigris copper armour. It wore a helm of the same armour, from where burned a dull flame in place of eyes. It came to rest at a clear spot in the transept, its head slowly surveying the empty space as its stone tail rose behind it, tipped with another halberd-head. For a moment, it looked around the nave, and saw nothing, so moved closer to the transept. Nilsen didn't wait any longer."]},{heading:"Death from Above",paragraphs:["As your hound looked on, you lept down onto the back of the huge gargoyle, driving your greatsword between its wings. It roared, struggling to remove you from its back as you struck at its joints with merciless chops. Rachel took cover behind the arches of the gallery, and aimed a mind sliver at the guardian, but it rejected such an intrusion. Pryce knocked the creature back a step with blasts of darkness from his fingertips as the gargoyle finally managed to throw Nilsen free. It swung the halberd, catching you as you tried to parry, and opening a wound on your shoulder. It hit hard, a huge weight behind its strikes, but you managed to dodge its tail strike.  Riswyn looked at the steps alongside her, too far away to reach the gargoyle from. You dropped the crank handle, lept across the gap to the chandelier, and drew shatterspike. The blade's adamantine flecks glittered in the candlelight, and as you lept off the metal chandelier, your golden clothing gleamed. The huge gargoyle turned too late. You plunged the sword into a weak point opened by Nilsen. Like a spike in stone, you split the creature apart from the spine, felt it crumble beneath you. Your boots hit the tiled floor, and either side of you fell the ruins of the guardian.","The others stood and blinked in disbelief as the dust settled. The acolyte murmured a little tune he was singing, almost coming-to. You tied him tight to a column, and finished the cranks. The steps dropped, sliding into place to form a stair down beneath the altar."]},{heading:"Taking the Company Crypto",image:"./img/bell_tower_gargoyle.webp",paragraphs:["As you descended, you saw a candle lighting a crypt chamber in the distance.

You closed up the entrance again, as the unconscious young cleric murmured his tune in his sleep among the broken chunks of the guardian gargoyle.","You stepped into a richly-decorated crypt, a vaulted ceiling to a room lined with stone sarcophagi and paved in chequerboard tiles. Lit torches gave off a magical aura discerned by Rachel, and proved too much for Nilsen to avoid treating like levers for secret doors. The torches illuminated wall carvings and impish gargoyles on the columns in the middle of the room. Bragi and Pryce examined the coffins to read the names of former Ardseres spanning hundreds of years. Odd, as the church above was clearly much older. A sanctified air hung in the room, perhaps the reason none of you voiced intentions to plunder these tombs. Agis and Pryce stepped to the far end of the room, and Pryce's wand found there was a hidden doorway, as well as something else behind him. Agis located the door precisely, and Bragi checked the stonework of the sarcophagus next to it. A gap, not enough to grip beneath, but different to the lids of the other tombs. Bragi felt it budge a little, and Nilsen, who has no time for budging, shoved the lid, and opened the wall hidden door.","You questioned the acolyte, who had finally come-to but had difficulty accepting his situation. He knew little of this place, only tales of things that squashed intruders and made shredded corpses of robbers. He was not permitted here, normally. And as Riswyn dragged him across the floor tiles and into the next room, he protested, saying that he'd not fare well if he ran anyway, so you cut his bonds."]},{heading:"Hidden in Plain Sight",paragraphs:["The room beyond the hidden door stepped down to a level with a single damaged column in the middle, and beyond that a parapet wall that led to two further staircases. Down these steps it ended in an ornate metal door, etched with intricate patterns. And in front of that door stood a tall limestone statue of a scholar. Nilsen played with the torch on the wall again, which, he was amused to find, actually closed the hidden door once more. When everyone was through, Bragi climbed onto the wall to get a look at the statue. Agis examined the steps down for traps, perhaps considering it odd that so few wards were placed about these rooms. But again you found nothing, and so descended to the lowest level. Riswyn looked at the pillar and saw a pool of blood to one side and a damaged stone face, but nothing obvious to have caused it, and no corpse. But Pryce saw the trail of blood leading to the wall Agis stood at, with a curious look on his face. you recognised it as another hidden door, but couldn't work out its opening mechanism. Meanwhile, Rachel stood in front of the statue. It was powerfully built, and muscular, apart from an atrophied left arm. You examined it further, and pulled the arm like a lever.","'It's not a swing,' growled the polite, but gravelly voice of the statue, as you stepped slowly back to the door.","The statue, which had a name it could not remember, was tasked with guarding the metal door. the statue threatened that anyone trespassing would understand why it enjoyed being made of stone and how squishy non-stone things were compared to it. It threatened, in a polite and passive-aggressive manner, to turn anyone who tried to pass through the door into a fine meat paste. It would permit anyone through the door who it determined was a faithful member of the Covenant upper clergy; in other words, the Ardsere, to whom it referred as 'The Boss'."]},{heading:"Like Talking to the Wall",paragraphs:["Rachel looked at the door, and asked if she didn't try to open the door, would she be allowed to pass through to the other side.","The statue responded with a knowing smile; 'If you mean teleporting or some such, be my guest,' it grinned. ","When asked about the bloodstains and damaged pillar, the statue seems slightly embarrassed. It hoped someone could clean it up, but there was a lot of blood left by the robber who came here just over a week ago. It also seemed saddened by the damage done to its plinth, on which a broken vase and some broken piles of books sullied the otherwise pristine limestone renderings of skulls and flowers. It hadn't always been here, it said, but couldn't remember where it had been before. As it spoke, it notied Bragi and Agis inspecting it from afar, trying to determine where, if at all, there was a command word, if it was a golem. It chuckled a little, and told them 'it's written on the back of my neck.' Unamused, Bragi recalled that it wasn't. "]},{heading:"Sluice and Juice",paragraphs:["So you turned your attention to the hidden door, and spotted the outline it should take in the stone work. The statue, amused at your poking around, explained that there was a stone that could be dislodged, but it always made sure to pop the stone back in. Together you located the stone in question, and it took three of you to dislodge it. But behind it was a switch, which opened the door slightly. Nilsen pushed it more and it swung freely and easily. Confidently stepping in, Nilsen saw an empty torch bracket at the top of a steep ramp that led down to a stone-framed pit. Seconds later, as Agis and Bragi stepped in, all three of you were taken off your feet and propelled towards the chute. Only Agis reacted fast enough to avoid falling.","Bragi reacted fast enough to utter a feather fall spell to avoid injury from the fall, extending it to Nilsen below him. You landed safely in a waist-deep pool of viscous green liquid, at the bottom of a flight of steps into a room with a door at one end, and a burned out campfire set before an ajar door.","Above, Rachel identified a dull metal plate on the wall next to the open wall-door as the source of the wave of force. You and Agis made a safe rope chain to the pillar next to the sarcastic statue. Agis' climbing harness would give a safe way down, avoiding the worst of the force-trap. As Agis set up the harness, you noticed another chute in the ceiling. From it dropped a dollop of green goo down to the foot of the chute, where Bragi and Nilsen narrowly avoided being covered in it."]},{heading:"In the Belly of the Jelly",image:"./img/jelly_nilsen.webp",paragraphs:["The goo didn't settle at the bottom of the liquid-filled pit however. It reformed into a large translucent blob, feeling its way around the ceiling of the room and extending little gooey tendrils along the wall. Nilsen drew his blade, and you sliced deep into it, keeping calm in the face of this new, odd threat. Bragi darted back, and placed a shower of blades between he and the cube. As Nilsen pushed a torch into it, and the light was snuffed out, you tried to pull your arm back, but it became trapped in the mass of this blob, as it towered over you and collapsed, engulfing you completely. Its innards burned with acid. Your skin became scoured through fine clothing and armour. You couldn't breathe, and couldn't move. The blob pressed on towards Bragi, becoming shredded by the hail of knives, but doing nothing to avoid them. It passed through them, and finally Nilsen managed to struggle free, falling to the left of it, fumbling blindly for a light source, and illuminating the driftglobe. ","The translucent menace almost had Bragi trapped in the corner, as you fired off a poison bolt into the jelly mass. It lashed out, burning your neck with an acidic appendage. You heard a roar, and Nilsen wasn't calm anymore. The Huorman tore into the flank of the ooze with one, two, then three strong cuts, chopping huge chunks from it. It gave Bragi enough space to blast the creature with a wave of roaring thunder, pushing it back into the slicing blades, which tore it to gloopy shreds, and finally destroyed it.","Above, Agis had the harness completed, and beckoned the others follow you down. But something niggled at Pryce. You went back to the crypt chamber, using the last charge of your wand to discover what it hinted at before, hoping to find another route out of the chamber, but despite the wand's ambiguous sense that something was still hidden in the room, you couldn't find anything.","And so, carefully trying to avoid the pulsing push plate, you all grabbed part of the rope chain and descended the gooey chute to meet Bragi and Nilsen."]},{heading:"'Pectin' to the Tightest Places",paragraphs:["You gathered in the room with the gooey pit. Agis and Riswyn took a few moments to appreciate the decor, badly damaged as it was. The walls here were different, of older stonework, and there was more than a hint of Elvish or Vallasaari architecture in the slender ribs and vaults of the ceiling and the broken remnants of the wall friezes.","Bragi took the lead down a narrow corridor, which was taller than it was wide, ascending up to a sooty, blackened ceiling. You tip-toed along, checking every inch of this place for anything that looked like a trap. It was slow-going, as Nilsen muttered from the rear. But even he appreciated, this was the perfect place to install traps. You turned a corner, spotting a hidden doorway to your left. Riswyn came alongside, pushed the wall open, and your face lit up with an eerie green glow, as the driftglobe reflected light back off the glistening surface of another enormous gelatinous blob. You cried a warning, and Nilsen came surging forwards to help you and the bard.","'It's not a swing,' growled the polite, but gravelly voice of the statue, as you stepped slowly back to the door."]},{heading:"Inspirational Quotes",paragraphs:["Bragi dusted himself down. You stood at the bottom of a staircase lead up. It was a grander stair than others on this floor, but the ceiling had collapsed in, and it was now impassable. But scrawled in large letters on the wall opposite the hidden door were the words 'You Left Us To Die!'' A chill going down your spine, you left the staircase alone.","Returning to the others, you took the lead again, painstakingly examining every inch of the walls. Descending the stairs as they doubled back, you arrived at a landing off which led two doors on your left. Scorch marks under one, nothing under the other, but strands of dried goo here and there across the narrow passage. And beyond these doors, more steps leading down and to the right.","Nilsen stood before the door, paused, and pulled down hard on the torch sconce next to it. It fell off but nothing else happened, much to your irritation.  You tried the door but it was locked. This was not your day. So you took two sides steps to the ri- left, and opened the other door. It led into a chamber with more decoration than the passage. A ruined statue and a grand fireplace. And on the floor a sigil. The same sigil as the wall sconce you now held. Riswyn stepped in, and spotted the stonework of the sigil was newer than that of the rest of the room. Agis examined the broken statue. Much smaller than the talking one back up the chute, and less imposing. Perhaps Vallasaari. It was odd; Vallasaari are a nomadic people, not given to making underground homes, never mind decorating them in such a fashion. There was a door, probably to the same room as the locked door outside, both of which had soot under the doors. Riswyn posited that perhaps someone lit fires here (someone who passed here a short time ago, added Pryce) to protect themselves from the blobs. Rachel knelt on the sigil, to the horror of the acolyte, who realised it was a symbol of the old god St. Vorennus, a pitiful deity of peace worshipped by heretics in the South, and worshipped here hundreds of years ago. ","The door opened with a hard shove. This one was swollen as well. The room it opened into was a longer chamber, more richly decorated still, much of it lined with soot from the two old campfires by the doors. At the far end of the room was another alcove and a statue, an academic-looking humanoid, mostly broken on the floor. On the right-hand wall are a set of alcoves, like large pigeon holes, each marked with an engraved wall tile saying variously 'try again', 'no', 'do not repeat', and 'possibly'. But alongside them, scrawled chillingly on the wall, in large letters, the words 'Vorennus Protect Us', and, even larger: 'VORENNUS ISN'T HERE, SCREAM LOUDER!'"]},{heading:"Notes From the Nightmare",paragraphs:["Despite the crazed text, you chose to remain here for a while, and examine the pigeon-holes. Pryce gathered up a collection of trash including a bloody and shredded brow cloak and smock, a makeshift shiv, a bottle of pure alcohol, and firewood and coal dust for perhaps three campfires. Rachel's alchemical knowledge led her to explained the bottle was a potion base, but along with the base was a torn and blood-stained note. The note read '3 passed here... [illegible] slow but clear...and quiet [illegible]... 1 knife eater, and horror [illegible]...'","Pryce again checked the remaining alcoves, helped by Agis. He discovered a mechanism within one, and triggered it. A stone released to reveal a hidden space behind. Containing. A. Book. Your eyes darted open.","The book was a small notebook, light leather, strapped shut and tied with string. It was a journal, recording instances of disease. And in the margins were remarks:","‘Our little hospital was moved again today, this time out of the temple precinct and into the slums themselves. Likely the mounting cases too much for the rich clerics and nobles up there. But the water down here is fetid, so we need to send lads up for more anyway.’ ","One week later:","‘These buboes ravage our own men, and still no sign of a cure. Not even the priests’ prayers can treat this. The gods test our resolve it seems.’","Two weeks later still:","‘Moved again. This time to the ruins under the temple. So much space here, and light. The painted walls shed so much light and keep us tied to night and day as the sun becomes a moon over the forest boughs. Can only guess at who made these ruins. Vallasaari hid here maybe? Or perhaps older still.’ ","One month later again: In the margins, beside scrawled out tables with case numbers is written:","‘Supplies moved down here too. But no-one allowed back up until a cure is found. Stench of dead becoming intolerable’ ","Two months later, beside a roster of alchemical supplies:","‘Not only stench now. Clerics sent to quell risen dead. Surface must be horrible now, we stopped getting the ill sent here, now just corpses. Office and quarters are still snug though.’ ","One week later, and finally:","‘Solved. Found the cure, so simple really. But challenge now is to reach the surface past the risen dead.’ ","Back in the hallway, Bragi and Agis led the way along the corridor as Pryce read the notes in an ever-more feverish tone. You sensed a growing feeling of dread as you walked down the passage to the foot of the stair and a door. Agis listened carefully, asking you all for hush. A crackling noise somewhere beyond. Slowly you opened the door, and stepped carefully into a broad hallway."]},{heading:"Hot Plate and a Burnt Pudding",image:"./img/huge_black_blob.webp",paragraphs:["You stepped into what appeared to be a main hallway. Doors stood opposite you and a crackling noise emanating from the ornate metal door to your left, down a short flight of stairs. In the opposite direction, the hallway turned a corner. As you assembled, a sense of dread began to grow, even as your claustrophobia lessened in the roomier hallway. ","Rachel walked down the steps a little, and felt dangerous heat from the crackling door. Magic, dangerous heat. Sargo, who had no problem with heat, fluttered to the door and peered inside. The room beyond seemed to be a dining chamber, with a large open fireplace, a dozen skeletons, and a lot of broken furniture. You left that door for now, and turned your attention to the two doors opposite the way you came in. Bragi examined the furthest one, which sat ajar, and within was an assortment of damaged furniture but little else you could discern. The door was damaged, missing its iron binding, like the other door here, Agis realised. Riswin walked in, noticing the door had no hinges and couldn't be locked. This was a long room held aloft by two thick pillars that reached up to the dark ceiling. More broken furniture lay on the opposite side of the room, and Pryce poked around to spot anything of note. You could sense something here alright (something not in the plans), and you could sense movement, everywhere, like there was something in the room. You said to yourself that was impossible. Until you looked up. And a huge mass of darkness engulfed you, burning your armour from your body and scarring your skin. ","Nilsen and Riswyn turned, and saw a mass of thick, dark strands of goo, which ate through the metal of Pryce's armour with ease, and slithered off his burned form to stand around eight feet tall and about as broad. As it moved, you could hear a faint moan, like a dying animal, and an echo of a wail as it struck out an acidic appendage.","Nilsen pounced, gritting your teeth into a frothing frenzy and hefting your greatsword in wide arcs through the slow-moving miasma. It split here and there, throwing blobs of black goo onto the ground in front of Riswyn and Pryce. Each blob reformed into a smaller version of the great black pulp. Three of the four blobs lashed out at the barbarian, wrapping you in acidic darkness and dropping you to the ground. Rachel let out a squeal, connecting to the mind of the darkness, causing it to flinch momentarily. But for a moment you saw into its mind, and into the cacophony of agony of hundreds of other consumed souls. Agis responded to the threat with a volley of arrows. These shredded one of the blobs without splitting them off. Pryce retreated, healing a little, and left room for Riswyn to attack with the battle axe. Pausing for a second, you used the flat of the blade against the moaning acidic masses, dropping a small globbet of the stuff into the floor where it died. But the axe was ruined.","Rachel darted into the room, and pulled the fallen barbarian to one side. You administered a healing potion, revitalising the Huorman. Bragi used the door as cover and send a bolt of poison into the largest blob. It struck out again, inflicting a burning lash on Riswyn, as the last of its offshoots was flattened by the dwarven knight. This left the largest slab of acid, injured, and with a weakness that Agis could identify with both arrows readied. Loosing them both, Agis sliced into the creature, sending splashes of acid across the room.","The thing was dead, its acidic remnants all over the room. You gathered your battered party together, and considered your next moves.","Nilsen calmed down. You nursed your injuries and looked to the others. Somewhere above, midnight had come and gone. You needed time to recover. Bragi agreed, as did Pryce. But all looked to Nilsen, without whom they might all need a lot more healing if he was denied rest now. The chambers moan and creak and drip and shudder occasionally, or maybe it was merely your imagination. From the hallway beyond, you hear the crackle of dust on the burning metal door. You set watches, but they are undisturbed.","During your rest those of you feeling fresh looked into the room next door. It was empty, bereft of inhabitants, including any clinging to the ceiling. On the walls were scrawled the words 'Vorennus Help Us!' and 'We were wrong!'. You hunted around for anything of note, but there was only a broken bed frame in one corner, and a broken chair in another. You could hear the others preparing to move on, and so met them in the hall. With no obvious way to open the burning metal door, you made your way down the staircase at the opposite end. Pryce looked back and pondered.","You made your way down, and at the next landing down was a gaping hole in the stone wall, from which came a fetid odour on the breeze. Your dim torchlight picked out only the archways of a colonnade below. But Rachel peered into the hole, and you described what you saw as a large open space, columns supporting the floors you're on, and between the columns, bones. Everywhere. Pryce piped up. Rather than go down there, with all these bones and dead things, why not let you try to open the door with a spectral hand spell? Would it work, maybe, but worth a try. And as you approached the door, and cast your ethereal hand at it, the door opened."]},{heading:"Leftovers",paragraphs:["The room beyond hadn't changed since you last glimpsed. It likely hadn't changed in several hundred years. Dust hung everywhere and piles of bones lingered in every corner, which didn't disturb Rachel so much as the impression of a figure standing in the room when you blinked, only to disappear as you opened your eyes. You looked carefully around the room, its broken furniture, and its grand fireplace on the North wall, and the tall vaulted ceiling with no huge black monstrosities clinging to it. But as you stepped into the room, the clusters of bones erupted, and reformed into humanoid skeletons that brandished weapons to attack.","Nilsen was characteristically right into the fray. You and Riswyn charged in, shattered skeletons with each swing, while a startled familiar Sargo took blows from three of them and was subsequently recalled by Rachel, who hung back beside Bragi. The bard turned and looked at a skeleton that rose behind him, slicing it down to size quickly. Even the gormless acolyte managed to drop one, hurling a ball of radiant flame at it. Blasts of energy from Pryce's fingertips made short work of another. Rachel -somehow- dropped one with only a rock or two. but it was the rapid reactions and instincts of Agis that destroyed the rest, aiming at the crowns of their heads with successive, precise, and deadly arrows from his longbow.

It swept through the slums, and a field hospital was set up there, but it soon needed more space, so they took over the temple and got help from the clerics of Vorennus. Until the nobility grew tired of the stench, when then took over the complex beneath the temple, at a time she says 'when a little light still shone'. They sent the sick down, but no-one could find a cure.","And the sick piled up and died. So much death attracted wraiths and demons that possessed the dead, and soon they needed more clerics to fight them off. But still the sick came, until the clerics above merely sent down the afflicted dead. Corpses piled up by the dozen. Some clerics came up with a solution. They summoned creatures to consume the dead, great slimes and oozes that cared not for possession, had no fear,  and had no souls to corrupt or feed on. It worked, and at last, a cure was found.","A creature was slain above ground, a horrid spawn of the sea called a Chuul, known to be in thrall to the routed Ulla Conir. It proved the source of the disease, and a cure was made. With the undead fought back, the clerics made their way back to the surface, but the way was barred by walls of translucent slime, a mass of Oozes that turned against them.

Agis asked who these people were, and you were answered simply with 'I know not, but they were starved and haggard, like prisoners, and they heeded not the physical wards in this place' as she pointed to the fireplace. ","Rachel sent Sargo up the chimney and, as expected, the fireplace erupted with a flaming trap. Shrugging these off, Sargo found the flue joined with another, the fireplace of the room which held a slab inscribed the symbol of Vorennus from earlier. But the flue ascended further, to a small alcove. Here Sargo found a pair of candles, and a vial with a silver chain, in which were two fingerbones. But beyond this alcove, a hiding place for these odd treasures, the flue was collapsed in. So you summoned Sargo back.","Bragi explained to Velma that they would certainly interr the bones, and would seek out the symbols of warding on the way back up to the surface.

Pryce took aim with force blasts at skeletons as they turned the corner into view. Two dashed at Riswyn, injuring you, as Nilsen beheaded another. Bragi looked for an opening, and loosed a bolt into one, as a chill went up your spine. You reacted and turned, to come face to face with an apparition of a dockworker, face twisted in hatred. It sank a claw through your armour, draining your life from your body. Rachel squealed, only to find a spectral nobleman standing behind her, chilling your soul with a lunge into your heart. You struck back, Bragi reacting first and searing it with your rapier, and then Pryce blasted it into pieces of spectral smoke. The other drew back into the wall, and away from the shrieking Rachel. Arrows again rained in, hitting only Pryce. Agis lined up another shot, downing his mark, and damaging another for Riswyn’s blade to finish. You kept your awareness, and lifted your new shield up to parry an incoming blow from an axe-wielding skeleton that was destined for Nilsen.","Behind the final two lumbered the hulking giant skeleton, and they darted into combat with Riswyn and Agis as the giant climbed the stairs, reaching for Nilsen. From the wall the spectral nobleman lunged at Pryce, finding itself then the target of Rachel’s hex, which it shrugged off. It didn’t shrug off Pryce’s psychic bolts so easily, and you backed it towards the wall, for Bragi to finish off with a blast of thunder that reverberated around the entire complex. Riswyn again took a blade to the thigh - just a fleshwound – and answered with a longsword crack of the creature’s skull. Nilsen pulled out a javelin and you hurled it at the giant beast, momentarily knocking it from its stride as it came forward on all-fours, eager to pull your flesh apart. It flinched for a moment as a glimmer of metal appeared in the air above it, then more, and yet more. It reared back, uttering a horrific howl as a dozen blades rained upon it, shredding bone from socket. It could find no way past, and so it bellowed back and charged back down the staircase and out of sight. You could hear the knocking of bone on stone around the central cloister, but thought better of pursuing it. Instead, Pryce stepped up and smashed open the door of the room at the corner you took cover in."]},{heading:"Room With No View",paragraphs:["The room beyond was a mess. It looked like a futile last stand of a few soldiers, judging by the pitted arms and wrecked armour strewn about. Around the corner stood a battered barricade that toppled loudly the moment Riswyn went near it. Behind it lay a desiccated grey corpse wearing ruined armour with a symbol of Vorennus embossed in the breastplate. The old cleric (or perhaps paladin) lay on top of a cloth that covered a shield. Riswyn picked it up and saw her face in it, almost a perfect mirror surface. But you already had a shield, so you passed this one to Nilsen, who examined his beard in it and slung it onto his back. All the while, Pryce was fascinated by the wall opposite the door. Here was an alcove, and in it was a perfect replica of a window, but without the glass; only a flat, blank stone face. Riswyn examined it too, and Rachel looked at it through her eldritch sight. The background magic of the whole complex grew stronger here, if only a little. But the stonework was centuries old, maybe even a millennium old or more. But it was perfect, as if someone had petrified a typical wooden window frame. To cheer everyone up, Pryce flashed an illusion of some hills and trees into the window. It seemed to work, but for the corpses everwhere. And so, despite liturgical differences, you encouraged the acolyte to perform burial rites over the corpse.","Stepping out again, you carefully made your way down the steps to the door from which torchlight shone. Nilsen grabbed another wall sconce on the way down, and it was clear to Riswyn that these sconces were not part of the original complex, hammered in as they were with crude metal nails. Rachel sent Sárgo under the door and scouted ahead. Within was a long chamber filled with broken benches, broken braziers and alchemical equipment, and rubble, lit with a single torch at one end. To Sárgo’s right was a grand fireplace, with an curved line engraved around it. Outside, Bragi got to the door and pushed it open. As you stepped in, the door slammed shut again, and only Nilsen managed to roll in before it did."]},{heading:"Sticks and Stones",paragraphs:["The torch flickered, and as you began to hear singing from somewhere, you saw many of the items in the room begin to levitate, and then hurtle towards you both. Bragi, you were forced into the air and smashed against the ceiling, only to take further injury as the ground came hurtling back at you. Nilsen took some furniture to the chest.","Bragi and Nilsen looked everywhere for the creature that was either singing or throwing things at them. Nilsen swung at somewhere near the middle of the room, but hit nothing. Bragi got up and searched around the fireplace, from where the singing seemed to come. Outside, Pryce applied his hands to the door and pulled the trigger, blasting the lock off noisily. Blasting most of the door off in fact. The acolyte looked over Pryce’s shoulder and saw four skeletons turning the corner, bows drawn. He took an arrow to the knee, but it was just a flesh-wound and wouldn’t affect his career. Then another struck Riswyn, but Rachel backed away from the corner up the steps and then dropped a huge cloud of darkness on the skeletal archers. But over your shoulder, you saw a huge boney arm haul the giant skeleton over the parapet wall from below.","Riswyn charged into the room, looking for something to hit. Bragi immediately noticed something wasn’t right in the corner near the door, and you launched a salvo of magic missiles at it. Nilsen fought through a hail of old candlesticks and pottery to the corner of the room and felt a chill in your head. Riswyn looked back out of the door, and saw two skeletons run past to attack Pryce, and so you cut them off and destroyed one with a magic missile. Pryce obliterated the other with a storm of eldritch energy. Another skeleton loosed an arrow to Rachel but missed, and Rachel ran back down the stairs and away from the giant, pointing your wand at the unlucky archer and destroying it in a hail of magical missiles. But Bragi tracked the invisible presence, skewered and destroying it. And you learned of the return of your old giant foe, and stepped out of the room at last. It had marauded down the stairs and threw a rock at Pryce, but missed. In the room, Riswyn looked around and saw an apparition gliding around above Nilsen, and without anything to hide, it now lunged down at the Huorman, sending him back from the corner, and you swung your blade back at it, unsure of exactly where it lay, and connected with two savage strikes to destroy it. And all of the floating and flying detritus now fell to the ground."]},{heading:"Always with the Knives",paragraphs:["Beyond the room, and its singing, the huge quadrupedal skeleton came on, and Bragi faced it down, goading it on until it got almost within reach. And then it stopped, roaring, as the air erupted with knives that shredded it again. Pryce sent a volley of blasts at it, and Rachel whispered a scream into its soul. It turned and fled, before regaining its wits and coming back for more. As it returned, it surveyed the knife cloud and Bragi taunting it on the other side. The acolyte threw  a tiny radiant fireball at the beast, Sargo hampered it then struck at the back of the thing, and finally it could take no more. It  lept through the knives at Bragi, swinging wildly but Bragi ducked, and the knives rained down on it, chewing through its bones, and shattering the spell that animated it. The final skeleton archer made a retreat somewhere in the darkness.","And now all that remained was the singing.","You waited to patch up some injuries. The singing continued. Riswyn examined the fireplace, and Nilsen decided to check if the flue was clear above and threw a bottle of alcohol and a lit rag at it. The flames and smoke erupted and seemed to take a lot of the smoke before it began to gather in the room. When the inferno died down, Valthoom slithered up the chimney to investigate. And sure enough, the be-tentacled, creeping horror found that the chimney flue doubled back down to another adjacent room."]},{heading:"Ifhalla the White Lady",image:"./img/ifhalla.webp",paragraphs:["This room was well-decorated, and in better condition than the others. It was lined with opulent cabinets and desks, and in the middle of the room was a woman who sat on the floor singing. Around her were several items, including a cittern, some gems, a chalice, and a jewellery box. She spoke gently to Valthoom, and then directly to Pryce through the wall as if it were you in the room, not your familiar. She asked you to join her, to find the entrance to the room through a secret panel in a cupboard in the room adjacent. And true enough, there was no door in the room in which she sat. So you cautiously made your way along the corridor to the corner, and to a door that lay ajar. Beyond was once a bedroom, with broken cabinets and smashed lanterns adorning the walls. On one wall stood a smashed and rotting bedframe, and on another was a stone window. Opposite the bedframe was a wardrobe in good condition, and you found its back to be a false panel. It swung around to reveal the room beyond.  A symbol of Vorennus carved into the floor at the threshold beyond the closet. Bragi stepped over it first, drawing a gasp of glee from the lady in the middle of the room. Everyone stepped into the chamber, and the lady grew more excited. Rachel was last in, reluctantly stepping over the symbol on the floor, but the acolyte dared not cross it.","The woman spoke with a fragile, honeyed voice, firstly quizzing Bragi on the world, and asking if you were all here to study. She noticed Bragi was half-Vallasaari, and you realised that she was Vallasaari too. And she asked if you were here to study, had you spoken to the Dean, her wonderful Dean, whom she addressed as Remulen, and whose office was on the floor below.","She beckoned Rachel over to play with her trinkets, and let you examine them. In fact, you spotted that one of the items exhibited a strong magical aura, the cittern embellished with scrollwork and Heathen knots.  Ifhalla shone with happiness at your presence, and said she had toys for Rachel to play with. Nilsen questioned what this place was, but she remained coy about what knowledge she possessed. A trinket or another toy might work as a show of friendship, she suggested. Pryce passed over a bloodstone, graciously accepted. You asked agin, and for how long she had been here. She responded that she was a tutor, and came here to protect the knowledge of the elders with her beloved Remulen, and pass it on, hidden away from the harrowing hand of the Meargha. She explained to you that they came here, to the lands above, and hunted for something, deep and hidden, among the roots of the land. And you got dizzy for a moment, as those words triggered a memory or a vision. A dark pit, roots disappearing into it, and a ring of runes around the edge; runes branded onto your backs. She went quiet now, whispering that nothing could stay hidden forever, and when the power of this place waned and the Ulla Conir ruled the land. And when the windows lost their shine, and the sunlight of lost Ilantha was gone. Riswyn recalled that much of what she said sounded like the tales of ancient history, almost one-thousand years earlier.","You explained that you needed to go and find Remulen. She clapped her hands with glee and said how she kept all of the things from his study desk, like the little prism toy. And she sensed life from below that he might still be there. You should go and begin your studies. But she could not. And she wept as she said that she didn't want to be alone again. Rachel must stay, remain here, and play with the toys. And argue as you might, and persuade as you tried, she was adamant that someone should stay behind, and she liked the girl best. Perhaps a reminder of the children she and Remulen intended. But as you argued with her, her visage changed, and her veil of comeliness faded. Momentarily, she appeared as a withered crone, translucent and evil, and from the closet the acolyte mutter 'I knew this was a bad idea'. But as a favour she let Rachel chose an item. Bragi licked his lips at the thought of a magical instrument, but you chose the trinket box instead. And so Rachel offered to remain here, and asked that you go and find Remulen for her.","The ghostly woman set the toys out for you to play, and combed her hair as the others left the room. You picked up the cittern to try to play with it, putting the trinket box in your pocket, and closing your eyes to concentrate on the notes. The others had gone back into the bedroom adjacent, along with Sargo. For a second you saw through Sargo's eyes, and in a puff of smoke, you vanished, to appear, via a misty step, in the hallway outside.","It only took seconds, but Ifhalla suddenly knew, and her rage at being duped was terrifying. You felt it tear through each of your minds like a wave of pain and fear. A scream that echoed in both worlds, and catapulted you to the darkness of your first and greatest fears. You recalled horrors that forced your child-like mind to harden, your age of infancy gone in a flash, your mortality made manifest. Tears pooled in your rigid, open eyes, and you stood still for a moment until the terror passed. Pryce, Bragi, and the acolyte dropped to the ground, soon to die. When your minds were clear, Rachel and Nilsen helped the others recover, and closed the closet door, retreating back into the hall."]}],Ng={title:xg,sections:Ag},Rg="Deep Academy Cloister",Eg=[{paragraphs:["You were rejoined by Agis, who helped you back to the barricade room to heal your wounds. The singing had stopped, and as dawn broke in the world above, you felt the power of some items restored.","Bragi led the way back to the destroyed passage, with a gaping hole, over which Nilsen lept with ease. You fastened a rope to help the others across, but Bragi lost footing and almost fell, but reacted quickly enough to stall your fall and grasp the edge of the walkway. The hole led down to a pit of bones thirsty feet below. With the gap traversed, you carefully stepped around the corner and down a flight of stairs, behind the wall again, and away from the central open chamber. Another hallway wrapped around the chamber, with a doorway halfway along, and a gaping hole where the staircase down to the bone-covered floor should be.  As you drew closer to it, you recognised this door was sealed against the stonework, and Rachel saw the magic emanating from it. A warded door.","Pryce spotted a celestial inscription 'Only the purest spirits may enter, unlike those that dwell outside', and neither Agis, Nilsen, nor Riswyn could prise the door open. Bragi considered the bottles of potion spirit base in his pouch, but having imbibed quite a few potions already you were in no mood to drink pure alcohol just yet. Nevertheless, when you tried to push the door, it opened freely, and the ward was broken."]},{heading:"Unsafe Haven",paragraphs:["The door opened in front of you to reveal a large room that showed signs of habitation more recent than many of the rooms here. Broken furniture continued the theme of this level, but a lot of it was split up to use as firewood, and there was evidence of a campfire used to cook food. Small bones, perhaps rats, littered the area. But across the walls, the inhabitant seems to have scrawled writing:","‘No, no, no, no, NO! I will not die like the others!’ was scrawled across the shorter wall.","‘I hear them beyond the door, waiting, hungry. To retreat here, trapped, and feel myself die by the second. Both stupid and luckless.’","‘Anyone finding this, please, free my fellows below and tell the king what Mausel is doing here. Save us from the Abomination.’","But there was no remains of anyone here. Perhaps they escaped or fled? Or perhaps they still lived down the collapsed hole at the north-eastern corner of the large room. You looked down and saw a room filled with rubble that led off south below you. Nilsen climbed down, along with Agis. Rachel sent Sárgo to help while the others investigated the large chamber further. Below, you found only a small portion of a room that had not yet collapsed. And here lay a corpse, likely for quite some time. It was a human man, and around his body he had etched something into the floor slabs:","‘It is over. I cannot get out. I will not become like them. I will die as I am. My name is Farron Dwall. Should anyone find me, bring my corpse to my mother.’ ","Agis looked over the body, assessing it for signs of how it died. The bones revealed nothing of trauma from an attack, but both legs were broken. Likely Farron Dwall died from starvation after falling down this hole, unable to climb out and unable to magically heal his injury. A pathetic, banal death, in a place filled with so many horrifying threats."]},{heading:"A Shortcut to Squashedrooms",paragraphs:["But Sárgo spotted enough gaps in the collapsed rubble to squeeze through. So you sent your imp, and eventually, it found another chamber in the rubble, strewn with very old corpses, many with tattered cloaks of the old 'god' Vorennus. Most lay under rubble, and inaccessible, but one was apart from the others, propped against a wall. It wore damaged armour and alongside it a bastard sword rested in its fine scabbard, still gleaming after so long. After crawling over it, Sárgo spotted two exits from the chamber. Both narrow, but enough to squeeze a person through. Sárgo made its way to the southern gap in the wall, and there looked into another chamber that had mostly collapsed. But here the floor was a little damp and a depression in the floor was filled with a murky liquid in which things swam. Before discovering if they were mermaids or mini-kraken, Sárgo returned to the room with the paladin corpse, through the rubble, and back up the hole in the floor to rejoin you all. Only the acolyte held back, pondering silently what his master the Ardsere Mausel could 'be doing here', as the graffiti suggested."]},{heading:"Crunch Time",paragraphs:["You gathered back your rope and tools, and prepared to descend the hole where the stairs to the skeletal pit should be. You dropped a rope down, and one by one your boots hit the thick carpet of bones that formed the floor here. Every step you took, to adjust your step, to reposition for the next person coming down, echoed a crunch of bone meal as you crushed and shifted the bones under your feet. The quiet here made it worse, but what really hit home was the recollection from the chirurgeon's notes that this is not only where bodies decomposed, but also where the leaders above discarded the diseased living. You could all sense the thinness of the veil between the world of the living and the dead here, but those of you with the power to harness the Itheria could almost feel the press of it against your minds.","The acolyte came last, offering a whispered prayer perhaps in fear, or perhaps asking forgiveness to the souls of the corpses upon which his boots came to rest.","You stood together at the northern end of a bone-filled cloister, like that of the church abbey above, with a high, arched ceiling. The cloister looked into a central chamber, perhaps 60-70 feet high, ringed by the openings that looked down into it. Columns soared up to support the vaulted ceiling that had partially collapsed to allow Rachel a glimpse down many hours ago. The sea of bones that confronted you was formed into drifts at the columns and against the walls, undulating unevenly across the chamber. And Rachel realised that the tallest pile lay directly below the plugged well opening, filled with green liquid into which you fell from the waste chute and the sloped passage that the sarcastic statue allowed you to access without squishing you.","It was from here that the dead arose to confront the chirurgeons and the clerics, who summoned the oozes to consume them, and who were in turn consumed by them.","And from this damnable pit led four exits. Two had doors but all had inscribed archways over them. Nilsen sent the driftglobe to each one in turn.","To the North was inscribed 'The Path of Ignorance' in Vallasaari;","Immediately to the East was 'The Path of Those Who Fail' in Draconic;","Opposite this was 'The Path of Those Doomed to Know' in Abyssal;","And finally to the South was 'The Path of Endless Death', in a tongue even Pryce could not recall.","As Pryce read these aloud, Bragi chuckled at the choice of which horrible journey to embark!","You winced again as your feet crunched through the bones of the dead and set off towards the least worst option: The northern 'Path of Ignorance'.","The passageway was wide, enough to fight two abreast, but it ended shortly in a heap of rubble. The passageway itself was tall, with a decorative frieze at the upper third, it too damaged. The deeper you went in the complex, the worse it got. But there was a gap in the rubble at the end, and you careful edged around the corner, where it opened into the room that Sárgo had explored earlier. The withered corpse with the decorative scabbard and damaged armour lay in one corner. Nilsen picked over the armour and you found enough buckles and metal to patch up your own damaged mail. Riswyn and Bragi examined the rest of the corpse. Dead for many decades, perhaps a century. It wore a belt, and in the belt was a little scroll tube. Whilst Bragi tried the knight's bastard sword for size, Pryce opened the little case. Within was a small scroll, and it read:","'I am Ser Reygal Mannaster and this is the testament of my final wishes. My sacred oath compels my fight against the undead and to whom they serve. My oath is to my Vorennus, but it is my love for my darling Serri that casts my will in iron. I have no nobler quest than to free this world from evil and remake it a better and safer one for her and my children. Should I fall, seek her out and to her grant the tithes I have set aside for her. In the name of all the gods, in the year of 1018.’ ","Rachel and Agis looked through the rubble, and saw great chunks of the former walls of this room inscribed with Vallasaari. It read 'Cleansing Your Mind of Mortal [unknown] is the Path to Immortal Knowledge'","The way out of this room was through a narrow gap in the rubble leading East. Sárgo had found a little pond there with things that swam within. So you decided against that way, and turned back.","You returned to the cloister. Agis led the way to the Western passage, 'The Path of Those Damned to Know', closed off by a pair of ornate double doors. Pryce and Rachel followed close by, then Bragi, Nilsen, and Riswyn. The ground shifted. Several of you stumbled as the mass of bones rumbled and shifted. There came a low moan. Pryce and Rachel felt it in their minds, but you all felt a surge of horror. The sea of bones , and a towering mass of red and green slime exploded from beneath your feet. It writhed everywhere, forming face-like shapes here and there to moan and snarl. Within its translucent bulk there were a dozen or more armed skeletons suspended, peering out with hate. And as it moved towards Agis, you felt the fear and hatred of thousands of the plague dead, of the trapped chirurgeons it was summoned to protect, and of dozens of clerics of Vorennus that could not fight it back. They were wrong to think it could not be corrupted. It fed off malevolence of the undead it was sent to fight and the evil of those who cast the living aside, and grew powerful over the centuries. ","This creature of living death, a slime of souls, lunged and grabbed at Agis nearby. And at once you were engulfed, your life draining slowly as you struggled for breath. Pryce Pulled from the Ethereum a creature of shadow and despair, draining the energy of all nearby with its presence. The slime could not move."]},{heading:"Hold Still, This Might Hurt",image:"./img/slime.webp",paragraphs:["Rachel and Bragi inspired you and hexed the creature, but it countered its immobility by expelling a band of skeletons from its innards. These ran to attack all of you, and whilst Riswyn and Nilsen struggled to get free of their new assailants, Rachel recalled the devastation her little stones made on the brittle undead, and made short work of them. Pryce saw the gasping Agis within the mass of souls, unable to move and dying. You lined up an angle on the creature from behind a column, and unleashed a pair of psychic surges. One struck the thing, and it shrieked with pain. The other struck Agis as you intended, sending him hurtling back out of its innards.","Gasping for breath but alive, Agis stood and choked down a healing potion before drawing your bow. The creature was not an animal; it understood the threat, and lashed out at the demon of despair summoned by Pryce as Bragi’s crossbow bolts peppered its translucent skin. As the demon was quickly overwhelmed and banished once more, the mass of souls slowly crawled towards Pryce. Within its mass, you watched as it pulled more skeletons from the floor below and began to slowly reform them for another burst of reinforcements. Riswyn and Nilsen, having destroyed your skeletal opponents, nodded to each other. Riswyn threw one end of a thick rope around her arm, and tossed the other end to Nilsen. You wrapped the rope around your muscle-knotted arm, and both of you pulled it tight. You both sprinted around the soul mass, avoiding the skeletons, and to the opposite side of the nearest pillar behind it. And with all of your strength, inspired by Bragi and taking advantage of Rachel’s curse, you pulled the rope through the slime like a cheese wire. The rope rent it in two momentarily, but pulled all of the skeletons from within it and, with your combined strength, bludgeoned them against the pillar. The thing roared, a dull rumble beneath the sharp noise of dry, shattering bones. ","Agis now took a measure of revenge, circling around the slime and sending one volley after another into the centre of its body. The first arrow marked it, the second tore a hole in its flank. The acolyte darted alongside you, himself covered in shards of newly-crushed undead bones, and healed you further. Pryce followed this with a further blast of eldritch force, and Bragi with more crossbow bolts. The thing reared up, the skulls and faces that form it grasping defiantly at Riswyn and Nilsen. But as it turned to face Agis, it let out an abrupt gasp as its translucent hide was pierced for the final time. The Vallasaari bodkin found its mark. You severed its connection to the souls of the dead and slowly the hatred and fear that gave it form dispersed. All of its slimy mass turned into air. Seconds later it was no more.","Rachel and Pryce felt the pressure on their minds ease a little. This was still a place of dread, but you no longer felt the instinctive fear that heralded the appearance of this horrid manifestation."]},{heading:"Doomed to Know... Where the Trap Is",paragraphs:["You took a moment to recover. The doors of the Western pathway stood firmly closed, and it took all of Nilsen’s strength to push them open. Beyond, there was another wide hall. This one ended with another broken statue of a scholar. A door on either side of the hall led North and South.","Agis progressed into the hall, taking great care. And it was well-warranted. Halfway along the hall, you spotted a tile that showed signs of mechanical movement. Looking around, you saw evidence of stonework scored by something powerful coming from the disfigured statue ahead. Agis stepped in to help locate an assured trap mechanism. But without the required expertise, you merely located the trigger. Stepping over it, you found three holes, surely the nozzles of a trap. Stepped out of its way, you tested the trap, and watched as it launched shards of metal at the area around the tiles. Once launched, you discerned a ticking mechanism, like a timer that reset the trap. Counting down the timer, it stopped, and you triggered the trap again, but this time Nilsen put a chunk of stone to weigh the tile down, and hopefully exhaust its ammunition. In the meantime, the trap fired, with slightly fewer metal shards than before. In the aftermath, you chose to step over the tiles, and go through the door to the South. "]},{heading:"Student Accommodation",paragraphs:["You stepped over the trapped tiles and opened the door to the South. The air smelled foul, almost briny. Beyond was a room that was lit by a pair of torches on sconces that illuminated a collapsed stone well in the middle of the room.

Around a corner to the South lay a pair of strong, silvered doors, and the torchlight reflected off some water at the foot of the staircase that led to them. Within several of the jail cells you saw manacles attached to the wall, and in one cell lay the clothes of a man, covering the restraints and fully fastened. The floor of this cell was a drying dark liquid and it smelled briny. You heard the trap fire again outside, again, with less ammunition than before. ","Pryce looked at the stone of the well, and Riswyn saw that it was old stone and a finely built well, but its parapet had collapsed in, and the shaft was full of masonry. But the ceiling hadn't collapsed. Bragi looked at the base of the well and saw a ring of polished, black stone. When you speak around the well, you almost hear it resonate back at you. Outside, the trap fired again, but nothing burst from the nozzles. It was empty.","Nilsen checked the other doors and found them empty.

The barrels were marked with the personal seal of the Ardsere, which gave the acolyte pause for thought. Riswynn looked at him as he pondered.","He caught your gaze and explained, 'Smugglers I think, captured the grain of my lord';","You considered it for a moment and replied, 'Actually, what's your name? You never told us.'","'You never asked. My name is Noote.'

There, Pryce recognised the runes on the door, and with assistance from Rachel deciphered a little of their character as a powerful warding against something. But Rachel detected only a trace of the powerful magic that once worked here. Wary of danger beyond the doors, Nilsen and Pryce devised a pulley using the well parapet as a lever. Whilst at the well, Nilsen heard whispering voices in his mind, but could not make out what they said. You made a mental note to stay clear of the collapsed well."]},{heading:"Pincer Movement",image:"./img/crab-people.webp",paragraphs:["Riswyn stood near the top step above the silver doors, and together you hauled them open. They moved easily for their size, and Riswyn saw a large room beyond, half-filled with water, with a light misty haze above it. And through the haze you saw reeds sprouting from the floor, kelp and seaweeds reaching up the walls, and tall broken statues becoming overgrown with mosses. A set of similar doors led out to the left, and a stubby pillar of some sort reached up out of the water, like a drum. But through the murk of the water you could see a huge hole in the floor, completely submerged. And somewhere, something large moved ripples through the water, coming from around the corner. Riswyn reached the doors in time to close them as a hulking thing scuttled into view. It towered overhead, and moved on six stemmed legs, protected by overlapping moss-green chitinous shell armour, and bearing two formidable pincers on the end of long foreclaws. But its lobster-like body was crowned by a head that bore two beady eyes above a maw of tentacles. And as one came around the corner, another loomed behind it as the doors slammed on them.","Nilsen dashed down the stairs and barred them with your hammer haft. It allowed time to draw rope out and make a basic tie. But as the first hammer blow came from the creature beyond the door, it almost buckled. At the top of the stairs, Rachel felt the ground rumble briefly. A drumming sound reverberated through the complex. And then the assault on the door stopped abruptly.","Pryce began a ritual, slowly sketching out a pattern on the floor, oblivious to the threat close at hand. Nilsen rushed down the stairs and, with help from Rachel and Riswyn, bound the doors together with a better knot. But it was Sargo who raised the alarm from the passageway behind you. Three creatures, humanoid, but with horrid malformities that looked like tentacles, coral growths, and spines overrunning their bodies, came stalking along the hallway, paying no heed to the invisible rat familiar. And behind them lumbered one of the lobster beasts, driving them before it. Sargo darted out of the way, and you rushed to intercept them. But at that moment the silvered doors burst open with several monstrous thuds from the bulk of the other lobster giant. Riswyn and Nilsen scrambled you all into one of the cells to make your stand, forcing them to use the doorway one at a time."]},{heading:"Feeding Time in Prison",paragraphs:["As Riswyn slid into the cell, you spotted a sea zombie turn the corner, and put a bolt in its thigh. Rachel conjured magic stones in her hand and the zombie took one on the head. And then Pryce pushed you both back into the room and obliterated the thing with two volleys of howling eldritch power. But the others came on, driven on by the lobster horror outside the door. Nilsen backed into the room as the claws of the other lobster giant reached into the chamber, slicing your shoulder and trying to pin you down. But you swung your greatsword up and sliced a claw tip off. You switched to half-swording in the tight confines, reacting defensively as the thing struck in again and again, pushing you back with its longer reach. Rachel and Pryce mounted psychic and eldritch assaults on it, as Riswyn peppered it with crossbow bolts. Its carapace was hard, and it turned blow after blow until your blade began to hit home at last.","It was relentless, still reaching in. Pryce realised that once defeated, another would take its place, reinforced by several smaller horrors. Too much, and Pryce began to babble obscene summonings in the corner. You felt the hairs on your neck lift as Pryce splintered the mortal realm momentarily. A manifestation of endless hunger entered the world, blotting out the light of the room beyond your doorway, and filling the academy chambers with the sound of crunching, chewing, slurping, and the roars of those things crunched and chewed upon. Nilsen's rage kept his mind oddly focused. Pryce smiled as the giant lobster horror's tiny eyes widened for a second before it was pulled swiftly into the pitched black maw, where you could feel the hunger barely satisfied for a moment. Then the chewing stopped, and the rift to the Ethereum moaned its endless hunger around the complex. Pryce snuffed it out, and sealed it away into the Ethereum again. Noote the acolyte just stared at you, scared witless. ","The coast seemed clear. No trace of the creatures remained. You picked a set of rusty keys from the leftovers of one 'sea zombie', as Sargo piped up that the other lobster horror escaped the maw and returned back along the trapped corridor. So you followed it back out.","You rushed out to the cavernous bone yard. The lumbering creature turned to face Riswyn and Pryce first, as Nilsen and Rachel followed with Noote. You both fired off bolts of your crossbow and eldritch force, slamming into the bison-sized thing, knocking it back for Nilsen to wade in. The Huor barbarian charged, fending off a claw and slamming the blade deep into the carapace of the beast. You took it in turns to weaken it, until it fell for Nilsen's feint and left its flank exposed. You needed no invitation, and wedged your blade deep into the tentacled head. Deep green and black fluid flowed down your arm, and the creature slumped dead to the ground."]},{heading:"Quite UnWell",paragraphs:["Rachel peered at the lobster shell and you licked your lips. At once you directed the others as to which bits of poison sac could be harvested, and which parts of carapace armour were worth dumping into the bag of holding for later.","Now you all returned to the large water-logged chamber and investigated that room now that its inhabitants were defeated. Almost every surface was covered in moss or some aquatic flora. The walls were green with algae, covering the recesses in which stood more disfigured statues. At the foot of the staircase was a lever. As Riswyn soon discovered, this slammed shut and unlocked the large silvered doors. Nilsen didn't let the prospect of a warning drum pass him by, and you burst the membrane of the thing before anyone could ruin your hearing. Pryce was curious as to how the statues were damaged. Large lumps that had an arm or leg had fallen into the water, but the faces of these statues were disfigured by other, pettier means, as if hacked at through malice instead of the mere passage of time. None of you relished the prospect of going deeper down the huge hole in the floor, so you tried the ther doors leading East. They opened easily, like the Northern set, sending a slow wave of water into the next room, which was also flooded.","This chamber was like many rooms that had collapsed into one. Some walls still stood, holding rusted metal gates into what seemed like destroyed cells. Plants grew in every recess, and algae overran the walls above the water-line. But in the middle of the chamber stood the parapet walls of another well. But this one was not blocked. Rachel could determine very strong conjuration magic from within, but also abjuration magic around the outside. The well shaft seemed deep, and an eerie purple fog gathered some way below. Through the murky water, you discerned a ring of smooth, polished black stone. Noote stood alongside it nonchalantly, peering over the edge.","As you searched the rubble of these broken chambers, Nilsen asked Noote to be careful around the well walls. Noote replied, sarcastically, that he should have taken more care not to be kidnapped. Far from being 'fun' as Nilsen jibed, this was a horrifying trial for him, confronting creatures that lived just below his feet. His path to being a priest was in danger, and you were all contorting the will of god by taking him from his calling. Pryce interjected, perhaps this was his will, and Noote nodded 'perhaps.' He mused a little on what he'd learned in the last two days. And then you noticed that as he spoke, writing glowed on the polished stone under the water. Then it disappeared. Noote jumped back from the walls. When asked which word glowed, Noote replied, helpfully, 'THE'."]},{heading:"From My Cold Dead Hands",image:"./img/clutching-sword.webp",paragraphs:["Meanwhile, Riswyn and Rachel were struggling to locate a mechanism in a side-room. A mini-treasure trove yielded some gems here, but when Riswyn located an alcove and found the mechanism, a stone in the wall revealed a well-wrapped and gleaming sword, with the skeletal hand of its former owner still clutching its hilt. Along the fuller read (in an old dialect of Carcaddis, across the Mur-i-nRos) 'None May Strike at Me With Impunity'. You packed the sword into your pack for inspection later.","Nilsen and Pryce checked the metal gate East for trapped mechanisms but found none. The door was stiff but opened with a good shove, and at this you heard movement across the wide hallway and gate opposite. There, you saw another flooded but less overgrown room, and to your left a set of steps up to some doors, inevitably leading to the corpse cloister. But to your right, where you expected to see a defaced statue, like the other wide corridor from the bone chamber, was merely an empty alcove. Nilsen checked the floor for traps, but found none. The passage served a different purpose, it seemed. Keeping one eye out for movement ahead, you and Rachel turned left to examine the statueless alcove.","Here was a plinth inscribed with the words 'The Stone Scholar : Heed His Warnings And Learn Evermore'. A decorative scene with books and scrolls on the ground and laurel wreaths on the ceiling above frame what would have been a tall, imposing statue, but now nothing remains. You turned to the rusty gate East which, followed at a distance by Rachel, Nilsen unlocked and stepped across the threshold. Several gates, both open and closed, led from the central room which was illuminated by a flickering yellow light from one cell to the North. You passed a small, totem-like statuette behind the door, and you almost turned to face it as your attention was caught by the lurching limbs and tentacles of three more sea mutants.

He was relieved that these new arrivals presented no real threat to him. He glanced round, picking the nearest of the three sea-spawn, and hefted his sword. With his friends’ spells whistling past his ears, Nilsen barely noticed when an approaching monster tripped as it ran towards him. Still, he swiped at it as it stumbled past and before long the last monster crumbled beneath his onslaught.","Growing frustrated with Noote’s lack of input into these fights, Nilsen took out his old sledgehammer and passed it over. “This should help you to get involved,” he said. Ignoring Noote’s protests, he continued, “It’s about time you started developing the skills to look after yourself. We won’t always be here to watch over you.”","Rachel and Bragi began to check the nearby rooms for treasure while Riswynn, Pryce and Nilsen went to investigate the body of a man that had been chained to a nearby wall. The man turned out to be alive and, to everybody’s surprise, he bore a tattoo that matched those of the company. Price began questioning the man and it was not long before he introduced himself as Felix."]},{image:"./img/felix.webp",paragraphs:["Felix told Pryce a story that chimed closely with their company’s own experiences; kidnap and shipwreck. However his freedom was short lived, as he was quickly captured by the Ardseer's men and imprisoned here, with at least one other unfortunate Branded soul. Felix had been helpless as the other man had been questioned under magical torture until he eventually expired. It was clear that the Ardseer was deeply interested in our common situation, and was none too sympathetic. However, like Pryce, Felix had no explanation for their shared markings. ","It wasn’t long before Nilsen trusted the man well enough to free him from his shackles and together with the others, they headed north to rest in their secure room. Nilsen spotted a second driftglobe next to Felix’s shackles and passed it to Noote. Passing the store, Felix took the opportunity to arm himself from the materials that the adventurers had previously found there.","As they rested, Nilsen took Noote to the side and began showing him how to use his new weapon more effectively. Noote continued to protest, but he swung the hammer experimentally and began to feel a little more comfortable holding it.","Bragi also took the opportunity to spend time with the weapons that he had acquired. He quickly realised that his style was better suited to the rapier that Riswynn had found, and he began to attune himself to it. Before long, he couldn’t imagine himself using any other weapon. In fact, he wondered how he had ever felt comfortable with another’s hilt in his hand.","Once everyone felt rested, the company moved on. They approached the final exit from the boneyard to the east. Pryce glanced up and re-read the inscription above the archway, “The path of those who fail”. The corridor turned to the north before opening to a room with clear evidence of occult activity, containing a scrying device at the centre of the room. However Pryce was more interested in the mantra inscribed on the wall, 'knowledge will open the doors but discipline will secure them behind you'. Frowning, Pryce looked further ahead where another mantra was inscribed, 'failure is the pain of a mind reforged into surest steel'. Curious, he moved forward again, to a section that had crumbled with age. Pryce grunted with frustration, as the section was badly damaged. All he could read was, 'mistakes... success... from great stem.. can.. only... surest...'. All of this must mean something... but what? ","Nilsen quickly grew bored with all this writing and followed the corridor further north. He emerged into a room with a large pool of water that he recognised from earlier. As he watched, an odd ripple spread from the centre of the pool. Nilsen waded in to see closer and before long the water erupted around him. Three giant Larva emerged above the water and turned to face him, their gaping maws dripping goo as they blindly groped towards him.","In the Sunless Citadel, Nilsen had turned up a potion of fire-breathing. He remembered thinking that he could never see why he would use such a thing, but he had tucked it away anyway. As he gazed at these watery horrors, he wondered if now was the time. He pulled the bottle out and popped the cork with his thumb before throwing the potion down his throat.","As they entered the room, the others were greeted by the sight of Nilsen surrounded by giant, gross worms, breathing fire over one of them while he swung his sword at a second.","They quickly finished the larvae off before working out what to do next. As they talked it quickly became clear that there were two possible routes out of the area. They could either return to the temple above, or they could explore the space below the flooded floor to the south-west of the compound. Nilsen mentioned the wells, but the others hushed quickly him.","The gang were not known for retreating so downwards, and wetwards, it was. Asking to borrow Nilsen’s driftglobe, Pryce jumped into the pool and drifted out of view. Before long, Nilsen borrowed the second driftglobe back from Noote, and jumped in after him. The pair began exploring the cave complex that they discovered below the floor. ","Nilsen swam through the caves, little wondering when he would catch up with Pryce. Despite his limited vision underwater, he thought little of the risks involved with swimming alone. Suddenly a tentacle shot below and swatted at him, attempting to draw him down towards the floor of the cavern. Nilsen spotted the giant eyes of an enormous octopus beneath him and knew he was in trouble. Taking a chance, he spoke to his driftglobe and daylight flooded the chamber. As the octopus cringed away from the dazzling orb, its tentacles flailing to cover its eyes, Nilsen took the opportunity to flee.","The company regrouped in the initial chamber and made plans to explore further. The group followed Pryce down the passage he had most recently explored. They began to head north until they spotted a group of chuuls. Although two of the chuuls appeared to be inactive, the group swiftly turned south away from them. Pryce and Valthoom explored a small chamber to the east of the main cavern, although what they found remained a secret between them.","While Pryce and Valthoom were out of sight, Agis continued south. Chastened by his recent experience, Nilsen refused to split the group again and remained near the alcove containing Pryce and Valthoom. Eventually the pair emerged and the crew followed Agis south, but not before Rachel signalled that she needed to return to the surface. Riswynn agreed to accompany her.","As his friends swam towards him, Agis turned and pressed on. He quickly spotted a group of seaspawn approaching and turned back towards the others, but it was too late; the first of the seaspawn reached out and grabbed his ankle. Without thinking, Agis drew his daggers and stabbed down towards his feet. He continued stabbing until he felt the cold grip on his ankle loosen, and the now twice-dead corpse began to drift past him. Nilsen, Pryce and Felix caught up with the fray and battle commenced. Before long the group had despatched the remaining seaspawn, and they returned to the surface to rejoin the others. As they turned to swim, Agis noticed that the seaspawn corpses were floating alongside them, carried on a current that they hadn’t previously noticed.","Once again, the group reunited at the surface chamber to discuss their options. They agreed to continue exploring the same passage and set off together. This time, Nilsen insisted that Noote join the exploration. As they progressed, the current continued to grow and it became clear that they were approaching an exit of some sort, from the cave. Before they found it, Rachel had to return once more and Noote, grateful for the excuse, agreed to accompany him back to the surface. The others continued until Nilsen, the fastest swimmer, spotted daylight filtering through the water ahead.","As they returned to the cavern, Nilsen spotted that the chuuls they had avoided previously were awake and on the move. He reported this to the others as they emerged from the water. After some discussion, they agreed that it would be better to fight the chuuls on dry land, so Pryce reentered the water and called to them. Soon, he hopped back out, followed by three chuuls.","As the chuuls emerged, they were greeted by a flurry of arrows and spells. Battle commenced. To Nilsen’s delight, Noote joined in the battle, swinging his hammer with all his might, and even occasionally connecting with one of the chuuls. As he swung, Noote let out a fierce cry, “take that, PRAWN!” Despite Noote’s greatest efforts, the battle was going poorly for our heroes. Agis became separated from the rest of the crew and quickly found himself held down by a massive claw and then paralysed as the chuul’s disgusting tentacles began to explore his face. Nilsen found himself crushed between a chuul and the ground, while Riswynn also was paralysed.","Behind them Pryce muttered some dark words as Valthoom giggled. With an awful sucking, tearing noise, reality appeared to collapse into a hole behind the chuuls. Where there once had been a pool of still dark water, now there remained only sucking blackness. And tentacles. So many tentacles. The battle began to turn. One by one, the monsters fell to the hunger behind, to Nilsen’s sword, and to Pryce’s incantations.","As the dust settled, a wheezing cough drew Nilsen’s attention. He fell to his knees beside Felix. Felix’s breastplate had been crushed and blood oozed from beneath it. As Nilsen held him, Felix caught his eye and smiled, “I will not become one of them, it is good!”","The company mourned their new friend before turning to face their next adventure."]}],Ig={title:Cg,sections:Bg},Mg="The Archives",jg=[{heading:"Book stacks, Stonework and Statues",paragraphs:["The party emerged from the gloom of the well into a blaze of light, as the breathtaking expanse of an immense library formed before them.

Hundreds of candles suspended from two enormous chandeliers illuminated countless rows of books. Two further galleries soared above them, reached by spiral staircases and connected by walkways at regular intervals. Pryce, his expression one of wonder and pure joy, uttered under his breath, “this is the library we were promised”.","Stepping out of the well, the party take in their surroundings.
