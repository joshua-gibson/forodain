            "All of you had been swiped from your respective lodgings, or tracked down in the streets, by members of the watch or militia. There was no trial, and you can think of nothing that would warrant this treatment. Certainly those of you who erred on the grey side of the law hadn’t done anything that serious. But somewhere along the way, you were branded, between the shoulder and neck.",
            "You wound up on a prison ship, whose guards treated you well, and in your own individual cells – not usually the accommodation afforded to petty crooks. You can’t recall exactly how long its been, nor what time things got interesting at sea. But many days into the trip – to Aeladh only knows where – the ship was rocked, hulled, and taking on water. You got above deck, where a gang of criminals found each other and killed the captain. They then commandeered a raft, and told the others to join them on land, far in the distance.",
            "You struggled on board the raft, some of you blagging passage on the gang’s raft, led by their leader, Basso, and his dwarf henchman Mattis. Others struggled onto one of the other three, picking the same one by chance.",
            "Your choice of raft was fortunate, as once you pushed off, the other two were overrun and carried too many. One made it to dry land, but the other capsized. Despite their cries for aid, you let the criminals drown rather than returning to rescue them and perhaps endangering your own raft.",
            "Hours of exhausting paddling later, you washed up on the stony beach. There, you saw the surviving crew of the ship lined up by Basso and his few men, and slain. Basso noticed your brands, and put you all in one group of branded criminals. He explained that, being branded, you were clearly a prized criminal, perhaps especially dangerous. Your survival would be noticed, and you sought after. If your jailors searched for you they’d not be searching for him, so he’d let you live, as long as you went where he did not. However, Mattis noticed one of your number was Vallasaari, and so shot him dead with his crossbow. To make it up to you, Basso snapped a longspear in half, and advised you to hunt to survive.",
            "The gang then wandered inland. Of the branded group left behind, several others would not travel with you, seeing as how one of you had the daemonic taint of a tiefling! Several of you - an entertainer, a gentleman, and a eerie young girl, wore locked, metal contraptions over their faces, intended to prevent the speaking of magic. These, the tiefling broke apart, and you hailed each other as fellow travellers.",
            "You gathered up what driftwood you could find. After a few hours, with night descending, you discovered a stream to follow. The stream led to a sheltered copse, where you found enough berries, roots, and water to keep you alive. Cold, dressed only in rags, and bruised, you began to travel inland."

            "The Next day, inland from the beach, the rains came on. As some of your party went off to find provisions, a tall, rangy, and unkempt-looking man surprised you all and came to the edge of your camp. The man was a deep-woodsman, a man who also bore a tattoo like yours. He made camp with you, and became one of your travelling number.",
            "As you broke camp, two of you went to explore the region further inland, whilst the woodsman went to find one of the deer he spotted yesterday. You stalked the deer after a short hunt, using a long-forgotten implement to improve the range of the spear and perfectly killed the animal, barely spoiling the deer meat and hide. When you returned to camp, a tracker and a soldier awaited, and took you to meet their lord, Ser Harmand Bryce.",
            "The other group journeyed for some time, finding spell components, before spotting a settlement in the distance. Before you could set off, you were apprehended by a patrol of horsemen, who took you to meet the lord of Carrick, Harmand Bryce, at Elsewatch. (edited)",
            "You were taken to the Elsewatch after a long ride, and spoke with Morten, the guard captain, and one young lad. The local folk knew them by name. The lands you passed through seemed impoverished and the people lean and cold. You arrived at the village and keep of Elsewatch at dusk, and were taken to the stables whilst the lord finished his meal. You met Fiddias, his well-dressed halfling steward, whom the guards nicknamed 'the Fidgeter'. In the stables, you chatted with the smith, and spotted that part of the block had been recently affected by fire.",
            "Ser Harmand Bryce, a grizzled veteran, met you in his spartan chamber. The fire burned low, and he offered you good food, before asking you how you got here. You were honest about the shipwreck, and he responded with an offer of a new start in these lands. His price was a small task - find out what started the fire and killed his best destrier. He had previously posted a notice in local taverns seeking help, and paid coin in advance to some mercenaries who went below the castle and never returned with any solutions, nor his money.",
            "You accepted. Fiddias would ensure you had arms, equipment, and a good sleep. The mood in the lord's hall of Elsewatch was relaxed, and capped off by song and music from Bragi and the woodsman, with Rachel watching on at the foot of Ser Bryce's throne."

            "Later that night, two more of you were taken into the castle. Although you weren’t afforded the same hospitality as the trio in the Lord’s Hall, you got to sleep on good beds in with the others.",
            "The first was a Vallasaari, one of the elves of the mortal world, an outcast descendent of the proud and heretical immortal race. The other was Fair, the Tiefling spirit which inhabited the form of a mortal. Neither of you were welcome in the hall of Ser Harmand Bryce.",
            "The next morning, Fiddias and Morten had you equipped, roping the Vallasaari and Tiefling into the task agreed the night before. Rachel alone got a shield, large enough to hide behind, and you received or crafted your focus objects and holy symbols. And then you were taken to the cellars, and shown an entrance uncovered by the mercenaries before you; a secret wall discovered and demolished. Ser Bryce then told you of the guardian they defeated at the entrance. It was a humanoid creature comprised of stones, powerful enough to require help from Bryce’s guards. The tunnel it guarded extended beneath the courtyard. As you stepped in, Bryce realised he’d asked a lot, and promised you possession of whatever they found underground that didn’t belong to him, and a sum of 100 crowns each. With protestations from the miserly Fiddias ringing in your ears, you went beneath the castle.",
            "The tunnel began narrow, descending, then widened. On one side were holes in the wall, where something had been hammered in, and the floor was carpeted with a bed of reeds, making it difficult to sneak along. It was Nilsson who first spotted the bloodstains, very old, on both the walls and floor. And a dampness in the air. Pressing on, Bragi’s keen eyes picked out a wall different from the others, marked with painted plaster, but none of you could understand the markings. Perhaps a skull?",
            "The passage narrowed again. Down a few steps was an open portcullis. Opened by the last band of mercenaries? It still worked, and the lever on the outside was perhaps intended to keep something locked down here. And then more steps down, the corridor widened once more. Again, hammered gouges lined the wall on one side, and empty torch sconces on the other, but a glimmer of metal revealed what occupied these holes long ago – a rung driven into the stone, and manacles that hung from them. This passage held prisoners. Further along the passage was a skeleton still manacled in its place, bones crumbling to the touch. Agis the Vallasaari noticed a circle of soot on the ground, as if a fire was lit here once. But as the party checked the area for hidden traps, a similar circle up ahead illuminated. And with a puff of smoke, dust, and steam, three small demons appeared. Chattering in a mysterious tongue, they spotted you, and charged to attack."

            "Bragi reacted quickly, blasting the three with wall of sound that disrupted them and pushed the dust demon back. The other two came on, but felt Nilsson’s warhammer. But the creature of dust spun a web of sleep over you, dropping Nilsson and Fair. Agis loosed arrows into them, Rachel, standing by the skeleton, screamed a discordant tone that rent the smoke creature, sending it fleeing into the darkness. Pryce formed eldritch energy into a lance that struck the dust devil, injuring it further. The steam creature, undeterred, blasted boiling air into young Rachel, but quickly found itself disrupted by dissonant tones played by Bragi. Pryce woke Nilsson from his slumber, stepping back to take cover as the lean figure hefted his hammer again. Agis’ volleys of arrows struck home again, and now the steam creature wavered for a moment, barely reforming. Nilsson put an end to its existence with a powerful blow, and now, struck by both Rachel and Pryce, the dust demon wavered too. Bragi thought fast, waking Fair, who discovered a fresh vitality and pounced at the dust spirit with her mace, dispersing it swiftly. And finally, drawing his bow a final time, was ready, as the smoke demon reappeared, chattered wildly, to send it back to the Ethereum from whence it was summoned.",
            "As you gathered yourself after the fight, you noticed the closer of the two soot circles began to sparkle. Rachel understood it to be reforming, perhaps ready to spit out more of the same creatures soon. She also understood that simply dispersing the soot would ruin the glyph. And with a wilful conjuring of air, she swept it away. Nilsson, shunning such extravagance, used his boot."

            "Seconds after you finished dressing your wounds, you met Risvin, a dwarf soldier sent down the tunnel by Ser Bryce to find out what happened to the last band. Risvin clearly came from the same ship as you. The more the merrier, you thought, and Risvin joined your group.",
            "You turned a corner into a chamber with a reed floor and two exits at the opposite side. A set of rusted loops held a frayed rope around the edge of the room. The low ceiling and a hole in floor in the far corner gave you pause, and you stopped to assess the risk. Stepping lightly into the room, Agis discovered that parts of the floor gave way under weight, like one end of a see-saw. Risvin proved his worth, spotting the flaws in the stonework along the walls and picking out which parts of the perimeter were trapped. Nilsson leapt across to join Agis, quickly moving to the opposite end of the room. The others started across, ready to set up a rope so others could avoid the pitfalls. Leaping to take the rope, Agis misjudged, and fell through.",
            "He fell into a chamber 20’ below, the same size as above. He saw a broken grate at one end, along a gully in the floor, which drained a spout that fed it high on the wall of the opposite side. A ledge above him had a corpse on it. The rest of you, seeing the Vallasaari fall, took extra precautions, but Bragi’s leap also failed, and he joined the ranger below. Others of you decided the danger could be controlled, and roped-up to cross the room below, instead of falling through.",
            "Nilsson had no time for this. You stepped through the exit archway into a room with a carved glyph on the floor. There were no other exits. The walls were lined with shelves, the floor muddy, and the ceiling held a set of manacles. One corner had some straw on it, which covered a drain, into which the carved glyph’s groove led. Fresh air came from a small hole overhead, which you guessed led to the stables - confirmed by Risvin. In another corner, you found a strange material, almost translucent, like snakeskin but softer. But then, the caked mud broke apart, and a figure of stone and mud blocked the archway back. As you turned, the glyph beneath you glowed and filled with magma from nowhere. Slowly a creature of molten rock formed. You fought off the mud daemon, before Fair and Pryce joined you, and together you dispatched the pair.",
            "You left the room and checked out the other exit. It was a dead-end store, of no interest. Below, you took a couple of hours to rest and eat, nursing injuries. You investigated the corpse on the ledge, discovering it was garbed like a northern barbarian, much to Nilsson’s - who took the equipment - pleasure. The grate above on the wall dripped now and again, but the outflow on the opposite side was smooth and slippery. Nilsson again took the lead, and slid down the tunnel at great speed. It twisted, turned, and dropped for several seconds, before opening into a chamber into which you crashed, knocking over pots and pans. The chute continued on, but this offered a resting place. The rest of you followed down the chute."

            "Nilsson was startled as a voice rang out in the cave. The pots and pans belonged to a gnome named Weylin. He was the last survivor of the group hired by Bryce a week ago. Around him were the corpses of his fellows, whose rations he was eating from the pots you knocked over. He was trapped here because, further below, was a scaled creature that shed its skin and came up the chute now and again. Weylin couldn’t face it alone, so hid here until help showed up. And you have. Looking around, your party found arms and equipment suited to your needs. Fair found armour, Bragi a bodhran, Risvin a battleaxe, Agis a longbow. Pryce couldn’t say what he found, but was visibly overjoyed.",
            "Weylin asked for help to escape his predicament. He said there was no point in returning to the surface back to the castle; his party was peppered with crossbow bolts from behind the dropped portcullis, fatally injuring several of them. The demons did the rest.",
            "So with no way back, you had to press on. Again, Nilsson wouldn’t wait long while there was a beast on the loose. And you were off. You dropped for hundreds of feet along the slippery chute, with the others following close behind. You landed in a pool of muddy, filthy water; a sump in front of another broken grate. Beyond that grate was a dark chamber. A door at the far end shimmered with daylight beyond. But beside it, breathing heavily in the corner of the chamber, about the size of a buffalo, was a scaly creature; the beast mentioned by Weylin. So you javelined it."

            "The creature brushed the javelin off, and turned. It spread out its wings, deep blue, and crackled with lightning. You jumped over the grate and down into the chamber floor. Agis dropped into the pool, backing up and drawing his bow. Then Fair, then Risvin, then Pryce, then Rachel, and finally Bragi, lept into the fray as the creature’s hide resisted your blows. You blasted it with Pryce’s eldritch hexes, Bragi’s whispered curses, and Rachel’s screams that shook its feral mind. Agis’ arrow almost skewered its throat, and it flailed its tail, wings, claws, and ferocious bite in return, all the while sending bolts of lightning from its mouth. Nilsson was felled by a bite as Risvin interposed to prevent his death. It seemed like the creature was about to charge up its lightning bolts again, but Fair’s longsword carried through its guard, sliding barely along its belly, and opening its innards over the tiefling paladin as it fell on top of her.",
            "It was slain.",
            "The beast had slain and feasted on the room’s previous occupant: a nasty, trash-eating Otyugh, and the awful corpse remained. When Weylin joined you, he couldn’t believe you killed them both. On a plinth, a chest was lined with fox furs, and it contained three huge broken eggs, each the size of a man’s head. One had not yet opened. Weylin guessed that when the first egg broke, it ate the contents of the others until it was strong enough to look for better food. The chest was marked with the blue and white crest of Ser Bryce. As Agis investigated the door, it was clearly intended to keep something in. Perhaps the lord of Elsewatch knew of this? Perhaps it was Fiddias’ secret? Either way, returning to the castle would be incredibly dangerous.",
            "And so, while Nilsson and Risvin broke the door down, the rest of you harvested the claws, teeth, and torn hide of the beast. Although not the mantle of a mighty chromatic wyrm, it could yield valuable ingredients. Fair took the egg, kept it warm, and hid it on your behalf among his belongings.",
            "Light spilled into the chamber as the door fell. It was mid-afternoon, and you stood at the base of the hill upon which Elsewatch and its village stood. Weylin pointed down the hillside. The River Else, the edge of Ser Bryce’s lands, was perhaps half a day away, down the valley. The Elseferry was the safest and quickest route across, so he recommended you make all speed to it, before Ser Harmand Bryce and his men caught up with you.",
            "You stepped out into the daylight. Your wounds were painful, but the cold daylight soothed them enough. Most of all, you were on the path to glory, and free once more."

            "You set off at once from the hidden chamber at Elsewatch, making north and down into the valley of the River Else. You had Bragi’s tunes to keep the mood light Weylin explained that the ferry was based in Camylborne, the lands of Lord Aldred; known to be a fair and wise lord, and in dispute with Ser Bryce of Carrick. Agis scouted ahead a little, checking for Carrick patrols and setting a good route by cover of the forests.",
            "Your wounds still ached, so you decided to find shelter and rest before making the crossing. You found an ideal spot in a copse which afforded a view of the hills back towards Elsewatch. You set a guard and tended your wounds. Oddly, there were large feathers littering the ground. Bragi knew of Rocs, but Agis assured him these were smaller than Roc feathers. Thankfully.",
            "As the evening drew in, Pryce Ward patrolled the camp. You heard nothing of the three bowshots that homed arrows at you. One arrow found its mark, and you fell to cover. You alerted the others.",
            "Backing up against trees, you all tried spot the attackers. Bragi and Rachel saw deep into the woods and picked them out. Three orc archers with longbows, aiming them overhead to fire down into the camp. Bragi began to circle around them, whilst Agis fired a bowshot in return. Rachel and Pryce could only take cover. Rachel was struck by an arrow as she did so. Agis cloaked himself in the woods, stalking through it like a born hunter. Your track was undetected by the orcs. But still they rained arrows into the camp. If you were to get closer, you needed a distraction.",
            "Pryce obliged, conjuring an illusion of shouting soldiers approaching nearby. The orcs were startled. They took cover, hid, stopping firing, and backed away, closer to Bragi’s position. Bragi pressed on, readying your sleeping spell. Agis was halfway to the hiding orc group, but soon discovered their strategy. Your next step hit metal, and jaws of a trap closed around your leg. Looking around, you saw perhaps a dozen more hunter’s traps, but you managed to get free before the orcs spotted your plight. Rachel was incensed with her injury, and screamed as she ran headlong into the woods towards the orcs. Pryce improved his illusion with the vision of soldiers approaching, and the orcs still hid. But then Rachel was clamped by a hunter’s trap too, and could not get herself free.",
            "The snap of metal traps helped the orcs see through the illusions. One fled for help, the other two stayed. The third lanced Rachel with a thrown spear. It lept out and charged. Agis’ bow tracked it and buried an arrow in its shoulder, but it kept on. As it loomed over her, it slumped to the ground as Bragi finally reached you and sent it to sleep. The third Orc lept up as it saw Bragi’s spell take effect, but was diverted at the sight of the Vallasaari nearby. It burst through the undergrowth and pummelled the ranger with its great axe. Agis drew his blades, whilst Bragi spun and drew its black blood from the flanks. Agis’ footwork forced its guard away, cutting across the chest of the orc and felled it.",
            "You took a moment to recuperate and freed Rachel from the trap, as Agis looked off into the distance. Something wasn’t right. Around the orc position feathers littered the ground, and a rope dangled from the branches of a nearby tree. In its boughs was hung a feathered figure, dressed as a Confessioner of the Shadow. Weylin said it but you all knew it; a cleric of the Covenant would be a valuable ally. Still, Agis couldn’t draw his gaze from the shadows in the distance. You cut down the cleric, a hooded kenku priest, who admitted he was ambushed on his way north.",

As the orc tried to warn it’s master about the traps, its head exploded like a melon from Agis’ arrow. So on the ogre crashed, headlong into the field of snares. But it simply kicked its way through the field on its way to you.",

It howled as Pryce’s soul reached out to drive an eldritch lance into its mind, but staggered to its feet. The beast lashed out with a wild swing of its club, knocking Agis out. But Pryce’s blast weakened its mind, and you focused attacks there, whittling it down step by step. First Bragi, then Rachel, and then Corwyn, your new cleric ally, who sent a burst of flame at the creature. But it turned to Rachel, its shadow looming over her. She let out a wail, screamed into its soul, and her terror pulsated in ripples from that scream. The ogre staggered, its eyes rolled back, and it collapsed to the ground.",

The rushes on either side of you parted, and three gilled humanoid horrors, skin sagging water, with large, glassy eyes, leaped to ambush you with their long, taloned hands. As an isolated scout, Agis is injured and dragged beneath the mud to suffocate, eventually breaking free as the river creatures are distracted by the rest of the onrushing party. You dispatched all three with some difficulty, realising the vicious damage their talons do to shields, armour, and flesh. But as they fell, sallow skin bleeding ichor, water, and blood, you saw movement from all around the river.",

You made into the squat building for refuge. The river monsters started to hammer on the door. But from the shuttered arrow slits you soon saw them slink back into the river rushes.",
            "You quickly realised it was a Covenant shrine, dedicated to the Bosun. Entombed within was a fallen knight of Carrick, who protected these lands over 150 years ago, and whose effigy is carved on the tomb. A candelabrum stood at the head of his sarcophagus, with a low-burning candle. It appeared to have been burning for at least a day, with perhaps only one hour remaining. Around the base of the candle was an inscription saying:",

From here you saw the lamp in the ferry house flicker, and you made contact with the ferryman, who seemed to have taken refuge inside. He shouted across that the creatures arrived perhaps two days ago, and destroyed his ferry. He said they’re not very smart. You saw from the rooftop that all the bug-eyed creatures looked at him as he spoke, and back at you as you replied. But their ferocity was enough to keep him inside his house; he won’t risk dying to get someone over the river. And he wouldn’t be able to come over with more candles, of which he had half a dozen.",

The creatures skirted around her, keeping their distance until the shrine door was closed behind her. And then they charged. Rachel’s charm spell failed, with Fair almost stranded at the foot of the wall, until Nilsson dropped a rope down to haul her up. But Fair overcame one of the creatures, so Nilsson instead lept down to lend support in the hope of reducing their numbers somewhat. Together with Bragi’s inspirational aid and psychic mockery, Pryce’s horrifying, nether-worldly blasts, and Agis’ bowshots, you felled the three at the base of the shrine. But more, a lot more, were just behind. You climbed back onto the roof, just in time to see them surround the lower portion. And then they began to swiftly climb, catching Bragi off-guard. One tore huge rips in his winter gear, opening a wound. Nilsson and Fair interposed themselves as Bragi fell back. The feral woodsman collapsed the skull of one bulbous head with his great axe, but Fair was quickly surrounded out in front. Her tail whipped in defence, but quickly she was overwhelmed and fell as a casualty. Before she fell from the roof, Nilsson had time to gather her up and run back into the shrine, where Pryce was ready with the door open. Bragi and Rachel retreated through the hatch, and bolted it at the same time as Pryce bolted the front doors again.",

The ferryman mention a master among them. Perhaps you could establish what this 'One Who Talks' wants? If that failed, you would rest until the candle burned out, and then defeat them as they attacked the shrine.",
            "So you sneaked onto the roof, while Fair went towards the river. You watched Fair step cautiously towards the river. Fair, armoured head to toe in chainmail and with a shield readied at all times, stopped ten feet from the river. After coercion, the leader of the river beasts spoke to the Tiefling. It asked the party to leave the shrine so it could defile it, as the bones interred there were of a knight that kept the river safe - and weak, at the creature saw it. The shrine protected the river. The creature, with a red fin on its head, explained that its master commanded this. And with that ultimatum delivered, it dropped back into the river.",
            "Fair declined, returned to the shrine, shut the doors, and explained what took place. You lifted the lid of the tomb within the shrine, finding only bones, but holy bones at that. So you took the lead, deciding to protect the shrine from this undead scourge. Unknown to the leader, 'Fin', you used your power to discover there were only six of the undead remaining, including Fin. Enough to lure away.",
            "And so the second plan began."

            "Bragi now volunteered to sneak across the river. The undead would be lured away from the river by snuffing out the remaining protective candle. As they attacked, the others on the roof could defend at range until the creatures came close. You'd try to hold them until Bragi, carrying the candles, returned and then lit the candles, banishing the undead once lit.",
            "Bragi snuck out and around the shrine, the others took their position, and Fair snuffed the candle out. Two river trolls rose from the water, and lumbered toward the shrine, taking arrows from Agis. But from behind the shrine came their leader Fin and the three remaining others. They snuck around as you planned your plans. Bragi bolted into the river. The current carried him downstream, but he ended up on the other side.",
            "The shrine was surrounded, and Fair took to the roof to defend the others. As Fin and his allies climbed up, Agis' throat gargled with bile. He was drowning where he stood. Rachel popped off a whisper of dissonance, but the creatures heeded it not. Pryce, cornered on the roof, blasted the back of Fin, then jumped back off and around to the door, where Weylin stood to open it. Fair faced down the creatures, defending the hatch, as the Vallasaari coughed up his bile and regained enough composure to make it through. Rachel was already safely inside. Fair lunged, missed, and had her armour rent by Fin's claws. Its human eyes glowed as it tasted blood. Injured, Fair risked letting them down the hatch if she collapsed, and so she jumped back into the shrine instead. This proved her undoing, as she knocked herself out from the fall. Rachel closed the hatch behind her and Agis closed the shrine doors.",
            "Bragi ran to the ferryman's house, where the ferryman dropped the candles in a sack from the lower window hatch. You saw across the river to the roof battle on the shrine. One spotted you and lept down towards the river again. From the door of his house, clad in many layers of ill-fitting chainmail, came the ferryman, who planted his tower shield in the mud, and levelled his arbalest. You dove into the river.",
            "Pryce took up position at an arrowslit. His blast arced out the slot, hitting the running beast dead before it got to the river. Rachel administered a potion to the fallen Fair, getting her back on her feet. The river trolls hammered on the hatch, almost opening it. Fair looked at the sarcophagus lid and wrapped rope around it and the other end to the hatch to secure it shut. It worked, barely. The front doors also held firm. You could see Bragi at the near shore, ready to return, but with no way in. Again, Fair took the lead, and hefted her shield as Pryce opened the doors. You charged.",
            "Your blade lanced into the nearest horror. With your whispered prayer, radiant energy filled the blade, and the creature was blown apart. Agis notched an arrow, Pryce fired a blast, and Rachel screamed a curse, but your target withstood. From nowhere, a crossbow bolt shattered its head. The way was clear, and in rushed Bragi at last."

            "But once in the midst of the shrine, Bragi fell, clutching his throat, as Fin stepped down from the roof with the three remaining creatures. It gargled a cry of triumph and tore a gash in Fair's chainmail, felling her once more, and stepping past the bard. The candles rolled from the bag, and Rachel picked them up, placing two alongside the remaining unlit one. You lit the two new candles, but on came the river monsters, Their skin began to char. The snuffed-out candle would not rekindle. Pryce yelled across, and asked what prayer was required to banish the undead. The ferryman replied that any faithful prayer to Aeladh would do.",
            "Rachel replaced the dead candle with the third new one. You looked at the candelabrum, remembering what the ferryman said. Only the prayer of a believer would light them all. And you knew no prayer to light them. Fair, the paladin, had no prayer to this God either. But in their midst was one who's kin held true to Aeladh in their elder days. Agis' life was upholding the ways of his dying people; he knew a prayer. He lit the third candle. Fin gasped. It was over.",
            "The shrine was bathed in light. A blast of radiant flame erupted from the three candles, ridding the three lesser undead of their stolen souls. Fin remained, but took the blast. And had it not been injured before, it might have survived. But Pryces' eldritch wound weakened it enough, and the holy flame of Aeladh blasted it apart. Only charred, dead bones remained.",
            "The protection of the shrine over the river went on.",
            "The ferryman met you and thanked you for your service. He rewarded from his coffers, replenished your potions, and gave you three cases. One held a map of the area. Another was a letter to Maynard of Ashford, soon to be his son-in-law, to take over as ferryman and river warden of the shrine. But the third was your letter of recommendation to his Lord, Aldred of Camelborne, who dwelt at Caer Camlyn.",
            "You rested, healed, and took the next day to help repair the ferry, proud of your deeds on the River Else."
